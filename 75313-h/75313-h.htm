</div>

<p>This work has been written at a moment
when the feelings of the Author are roused up
to a high pitch of indignant excitement, by a
statement of the cruel manner in which the
slave-holders of America deal with their slave-children.
Not being able to imagine that even
that dissolver of natural bonds—slavery—can
shade over the hideousness of begetting children
for the purpose of turning them out into the
fields to labour at the lash’s sting, he has ventured
to sketch out the line of conduct, which
a high-spirited and sensitive person would probably
follow, if he found himself picking cotton
under the spurring encouragement of “Jimboes”
or “Quimboes” on his own father’s plantation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span></p>

<p>The machinery, or ground-work of the story is
based on truth—the known history of the Boucaneers.
It is scarcely necessary to tell the
reader that the other parts are fiction.</p>

<p>The scenes are laid principally in the Island
of Trinidad. This is done entirely from natural
predilection, for Trinidad is the Author’s native
isle, whose green woods, smiling sky, beautiful
flowers, and romantic gulf, together with a
thousand sweet and melting associations, eternally
play on his willing memory, and make him cherish
ever the fond hope, that when the spark of life
shall have been extinguished, his bones may be
deposited on the rising ground that looks over
the sea, and that already contains the being who,
in death, as well as she was in life, was the
object of his deep love and high veneration.</p>

<p>Between the north-west coast of Venezuela and the
island of Trinidad there lies an extensive expanse of
water, known as the Gulf of Paria:—a name which it
has derived from the neighbouring Spanish coast.</p>

<p>At first sight this gulf presents to the eye the appearance
of a vast lake. On the north, east, and south, it
is bordered by the dark mountains of Trinidad: while,
on the opposite side the cloud-capt Andes, which terminate
in that direction, rear their towering heads, and
present a lofty western boundary.</p>

<p>The gulf, thus narrowly surrounded on all sides, communicates
with the great Atlantic ocean only by two
narrow outlets, which are situated at its northern and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
southern extremities, and are respectively named “the
Dragon’s, and the Serpent’s Mouth.” It is by these
narrow straits, as the reader will have already gathered,
that Trinidad is separated from the mainland of South
America. Shielded as they are by these elevated boundaries,
the waters of the gulf are ever calm and placid.
The hurricanes which periodically ravage the adjacent
regions, never sweep their quiet surface: and ships from
the ports of the neighbouring colonies usually avail themselves
of the protection afforded by this sheltered haven,
and safely ride away the tempestuous months on its
smooth expanse.</p>

<p>The scenery around this gulf is extremely picturesque
and beautiful. Small green islands are dispersed here
and there, and seem to float gaily on the bosom of the
slumbering waters; the forest-clothed mountains that
beetle from above, cast their lengthy shadows far and
wide, and the diving birds that continually ply the wing
over the reflecting surface, throw into the scene some of
the choicest features of romantic beauty.</p>

<p>It was here, that, on a lovely morning in the month of
March, two skiffs might barely be seen floating quietly
far, far away at sea.</p>

<p>It was as yet early: the gray mist of the tropical
morning was just melting away before the rays of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
rising sun, that was fast ascending from behind the
mountains in the east; a thin haze, nevertheless, was
still left surrounding every object. Scarcely a ripple as
yet marked the gulf, and in the quiet of the hour might
be heard the waking haloos of the mariners on board
their ships in the harbour of Port of Spain, as they summoned
each other to the labours of the day.</p>

<p>The two skiffs were at a great distance from land. In
the haze it was difficult on a hasty glance to distinguish
them from the sea; but, on closer observation, they
might be discovered to be a small fishing-boat, such as
those which are generally seen on the gulf, and a curial,
or Indian canoe.</p>

<p>There were three men in the fishing-boat: two who
were rowers, and one that was sitting at its stern, and
was apparently the master. He was of mixed blood: of
that degree known as that of mulatto, and seemingly of
Spanish extraction, but his two men were blacks. The
men were resting on their oars, the master was occupied
in deep sea-fishing, and the boat floated passively on the
water. In the Indian canoe there seemed also but three
men: one sat at the stern, the other two crouched in the
centre, their paddles were carelessly rested on the sides
of the light vessel, and the canoe, like the fishing-boat,
was permitted to float unsteered on the gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The two skiffs were not far from each other, and as
the haze cleared away, the master of the fishing-boat, in
the musing calm attendant on quiet fishing, observed to
his men, as he dreamingly looked on the canoe—</p>

<p>“Those fellows are Guaragons; I dare say they
paddled from the canoe the whole of last night, and
they are now taking their breakfast to get up to town
before the breeze rises.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sa,” briskly rejoined one of the boatmen; “dey
wok all night, all nakid as dey be dey; dey no ’fraid
rain, dey no ’fraid sun, but wen dey begin dey wok—wok
so—night and day, you see paddle go phshah—phshah—phshah,”
here the speaker screwed up his little
features to the utmost, in order to express the energy
with which the Indians are supposed to paddle, while,
at the same time, he endeavoured to imitate the sound
of the paddle itself, as it dashes the water.</p>

<p>“Awh!” he exclaimed, with emphasis, after this display,
“dey no get dis Jack Jimmy,” pointing to himself,
“foo do dat—no:—oohn—oohn,” and he shook his
head energetically.</p>

<p>The master smiled both at the humour of his man,
and the horror which he appeared to entertain for the
work and exposure of the Indians.</p>

<p>“And den wha dey eat,” he continued, “ripe plantin!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
dey eat ripe plantin fo brofost, ripe plantin fo dinna—awh!
me no know how dey get fat, but dey always berry
fat.”</p>

<p>The strange little man continued in this vein to make
his remarks about the Indians, and the master attended
to his line until the morning was considerably advanced,
and the sun had already risen to a great height.</p>

<p>“Now, my boys,” said the last mentioned individual,
“I think it is time for us to go, we have not had much luck
to-day.” With this he began leisurely to draw in his
line, gazing listlessly on the Indian canoe, while he did
so,—“but these fellows are taking a long time to eat their
ripe plantains this morning, Jack Jimmy,” he observed.</p>

<p>“Me tink so foo true, sa,” replied the individual
answering to that name.</p>

<p>“An da big Injan in de tern a de canoe da look pan
awee berry hard—berry hard—he bin da look pan awee
all de manin so,” and then looking anxiously on the canoe,
he continued, “an me no da see parrat, me no da see
monkey, me no da see notting pan de side a de canoe, an
you neber see Injan ya widout parrat an monkey.”</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this sage opinion, he
looked at the canoe again, long and anxiously, shook his
head, and moved restlessly on his thwart.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Jack Jimmy,” inquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the master, “you seem to be displeased with these
Indians?”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy made no answer, but gave expression to
a sound like “hom!” Then began to look into the
bottom of the boat, while he beat time apparently to his
own ruminations with his chubby great toe.</p>

<p>“But what is the matter with you, man?” again
inquired the master.</p>

<p>“Massa—massa—me—me-me-me no like close, close
so to Injans pan big salt water, so, no.”</p>

<p>The first part of the sentence Jack Jimmy pronounced
moodily, but he shot out the latter part with such
rapidity and earnestness, that the gravity of the master
could hold out no longer, and he laughed heartily at
his man.</p>

<p>“Bah! you fool,” said he, when the fit was over:
“what do you expect these Indians will do to us?”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy, much piqued at being laughed at, raised
his shoulders, and answered stoically—“Me no know;
but me tink we better go.”</p>

<p>“Yes: we are not doing anything here, and there
does not seem much prospect of having better luck,”
said the master, “let us go.”</p>

<p>He then took up his paddle from the bottom of the
boat, and put it over the stern to steer it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>The men began to row, and the little boat began to
move through the water.</p>

<p>The Indian canoe, which had remained all the time as
passive on the water as the fishing-boat, was now also
put in motion, by two paddles, and seemed to be steered
in the same direction as the fishing-boat. Jack Jimmy
saw this, opened his eyes, and cried, in a voice that
began to tremble,—“Dey da come, too.” The master
looked round, and saw in truth that the canoe was following
in their wake.</p>

<p>The three persons now became somewhat uneasy, and
anxious, about the intentions of their mysterious follower.
After a time, however, when they saw it was not gaining
ground upon them, nor seemed to be propelled with any
intention of coming up to them, these feelings were considerably
diminished, and they pulled calmly along,
while the canoe followed at the same distance from the
little boat.</p>

<p>When the fishing-boat had reached to within a mile
of the ships which lay in the harbour of Port of Spain,
the master was challenged by a brisk “Haloo” from the
man at the stern of the canoe.</p>

<p>“Haloo, there!” cried the man in a commanding
voice, “haloo, there—stop!”</p>

<p>The master paid no attention to this order, but pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
that he did not hear it, or did not consider it
addressed to him, and he remained silent; but Jack
Jimmy had not so much command over himself.</p>

<p>“Wha,” cried he, “wha eber yierry Injan peak
plain—plain so? hen!” and he shook his head mysteriously.
“But wha,” following out his reflections, “dey
want we fo tap foo—tell dem we no da sell fish, ya;
let dem come sho.”</p>

<p>“Will you stop, there—ho?” again cried the man
from the stern of the pursuing canoe.</p>

<p>“We cannot stop,” replied the master, “if you wish
to buy fish, come ashore. Pull boys,” addressing himself
to his men; “those seem to be strange customers.”
Jack Jimmy and the other boatman bent on their oars.</p>

<p>As soon as the little fishing-boat was put in a more
rapid movement, ten Indians simultaneously sprung as
if it were by magic from the bottom of the canoe, and
ranged themselves at its sides, paddle in hand.</p>

<p>“Wha, look dey!” cried Jack Jimmy, pointing tremblingly
to the canoe, “pull,” addressing himself to his
companion, “pull, me tell you:” and he himself drew
his oar with all the energy and vigour which fear alone
can impart. “Pull, me tell you,” continued he, every
moment, to exhort his companion; “pull, me tell you.”
Under these efforts the little shell boat skipped like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
feather over the water: but it was no match for the
canoe, propelled as it was by the vigorous paddles of
twelve stout men.</p>

<p>Like an arrow from an Indian bow, or like the noiseless
course of a serpent, through the lake it drew on the little
fishing boat. Jack Jimmy and his companion exerted
themselves to the utmost; the master too, plied his paddle
strongly and continuously, but nearer and nearer the canoe
approached. When at last it came opposite the pursued,
the man at the stern dexterously threw his paddle on
the other side, a rapid movement was made through the
water, and the head of the canoe was at once athwart
the little fishing boat.</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy could bear it no longer; as soon as the
boat was boarded, with a convulsive spring, he plunged
into the gulf; while the syllables of his interjected
“Garamighty” bubbled up after him as he disappeared.
But the first impulse of the master was to draw his knife
from the side of the boat, where it was stuck in a chink
of the boards, and with a deep-mouthed “carajo” was
going to plunge it into the nearest Indian, but his arm
was no sooner raised than it was paralized by a blow
dealt him with his paddle by a man at the stern, and
the knife fell from his grasp into the water.</p>

<p>“Fool,” cried the man who had thus struck him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
“what is the use of your resistance: do you not see we
number more than you? Get into this canoe immediately,
you and your man, and see if you can save that
strange creature that is capering on the water there;”
and he pointed to Jack Jimmy, who had now come
again to the surface, and in the extremity of his fear,
with his mouth wide open, and his white eye-balls
glaring, was swimming most furiously out to sea. The
sight was too ridiculous even for the occasion; the
whole of the Indians burst into a fit of laughter at poor
Jack Jimmy, who was fatiguing himself at such a rate
that his strength would probably not have lasted more
than two minutes.</p>

<p>“Paddle to that poor fellow,” said the man at the
stern, and the order was obeyed. But Jack Jimmy
would not be taken; he dived several times to escape,
to the no small amusement of the Indians: his
strength however began to fail, and he was at last captured.</p>

<p>They took him into the canoe, when he was almost
exhausted, and he was laid at the bottom of it, where he
kept his eyes closed and stretched himself stiffly out, to
pretend that he was dead. The Indians seemed highly
amused by him. At last, however, he ventured to open
his eyes, when, seeing some cutlasses and pikes that lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
by his side at the bottom of the canoe, he closed them
abruptly again and cried, “Oh La-a-r-rd, me dead!”</p>

<p>When Jack Jimmy had been saved from drowning,
the master and the other rower were transhipped into
the canoe. The master, shrewder than his men, thought
he observed, in addition to the circumstance of speaking
English, other marks in the Indians which resembled
disguise. They seemed more assured and less savage
than Indians generally are; besides, they had thick
beards and mustachios which the savages never wear;
and, above all, their arms, instead of being rude bows
and arrows, or at best rusty fowling pieces, were beautiful
rifles, cutlasses and pikes.</p>

<p>“But who are you?” he inquired after he had detected
these appearances, and become justly alarmed by them.
“Who are you, and what do you intend to do with us?”</p>

<p>“With regard to the first question,” answered the
man at the stern with stoical coolness, “That is not any
business of yours;—in answer to the second, be assured
that we mean you no harm. I hope you are satisfied.
Now, my order to you is, that you ask no further questions.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,—” the master was about to inquire again.</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the man in a voice that carried
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>He then took a small telescope that was concealed in
a locker formed in the thwart on which he sat, and
began to examine the ships and the harbour with seemingly
great care and minuteness.</p>

<p>This examination continued for the best part of an
hour, after which the man at the stern handed the
telescope to the master fisherman and requested him to
look also at the ships: “for,” added he, “you will have to
answer questions about them.”</p>

<p>“I know them already,” answered the master and
returned the telescope.</p>

<p>The latter instrument was carefully replaced, and a
small marine compass was taken out of the same locker
and placed before the man at the stern.</p>

<p>“To your paddles, it is now two o’clock and will be
late before we arrive.”</p>

<p>The head of the canoe was immediately turned out to
sea. The men plied their paddles, and the wind, which
had just risen, wafted the light bark rapidly before it.
Its destination, however, was incomprehensible to the
fishermen, for they could not possibly conceive to what
place a canoe that was thus turned out to open sea
could be bound.</p>

<p>But whatever alarm they felt, they were obliged to
conceal; for it would have been dangerous, they thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to break the strict command of the man at the stern;
and whatever they could have said or done, would have
had no effect on men who seemed to be little accustomed
to be crossed, and who, undoubtedly, had the power of
enforcing their will.</p>

<p>They resigned themselves, therefore, passively to
their fate: and did so with the greater readiness, as
they had not, as yet, experienced, from those among whom
they were so strangely thrown, any treatment which could
lead them to apprehend anything horrible or atrocious.</p>

<p>The canoe held a direct course out to sea the remaining
part of the day. This was drawing fast to a close, when
there might be perceived, straight over the bows of the
canoe, and far, far away, a small dark object that seemed
to rest lightly on the horizon, which was, at that moment,
illumined by the red rays of the large round sun that
was fast sinking behind it.</p>

<p>The head of the canoe was kept direct upon that
speck, and the man at the stern seemed to make no
more use of his compass.</p>

<p>Such was the rapidity with which the canoe went,
borne away, as it was, by the breeze, as well as propelled
by the paddles of twelve strong men, that within three
hours after sunset, they were close to that which, a short
time before, had appeared so small, so shadowy, and so
distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The object proved to be a low, black, balahoo schooner,
whose model, as far as it could be observed by the starlight,
was most beautiful. She was built as sharply as
a sword, with her bows terminating in the shape of a
Gar’s lance, while her stern slanted off in the most
graceful proportions.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable part in her build, was her
immense and almost disproportioned length, which,
combined with her perfectly straight lines, low hull, and
the slenderness of her make, gave her the appearance of
a large serpent.</p>

<p>Her rigging was of the lightest fashion as two simple
shrouds, which supported each mast, and the bowsprit
and jibboom stays formed her principal cordage.</p>

<p>There was not a yard, a gaff, or piece of canvass aloft,
so that the tall masts remained bare and graceful, shining
under their polish. On these accounts, they could not
be perceived at any distance, and a boat, discovering
the vessel for the first time, would be at a loss to make
out what floating object it was.</p>

<p>Her position also, and the manner in which she
seemed moored—mastless, as it would appear—was
strange and peculiar. She was not swinging to the
wind or current, but she rode under a bow and stern
anchor, which kept her head directly towards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Dragon’s Mouth, while the rippling waves, that still
curled before the gentle night breeze, broke playfully on
her side.</p>

<p>“What word?” sounded the hoarse and echoing voice
of some one on the deck, as the canoe approached the
schooner.</p>

<p>“Scorpion,” the man replied in as sounding a voice,
and the canoe boarded the vessel.</p>

<p>The ladders were thrown out over the sides, and the
man at the stern jumped nimbly on deck.</p>

<p>A sentinel stationed at the gangway lowered his
weapon, and the man at the stern, for so we must still
call him, passed.</p>

<p>The sentinel was a tall muscular man of a dark complexion;
his face was almost entirely covered with hair,
on his head he wore a red cap, he had on a red woollen
shirt, his trowsers were black, and were secured round
his waste by a thick red sash, in which were stuck a
brace of pistols and a long poniard.</p>

<p>These and a cutlass, which he held in his hand, were
his only weapons.</p>

<p>As soon as the man at the stern was on deck he was
accosted by a tall, thin person with flowing mustachios,
and with marks of distinction from the sentinel, both in
dress and in his appearance. He was richly and tastefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
accoutred. He wore a jet black frock coat, which
was richly but simply embroidered with gold; his
trowsers were of unspotted white, and displayed neat
and highly polished boots; round his waist he wore
a richly fringed crimson sash, in which pistols and a
poniard were also stuck; and a slender belt supported
a handsome sword by his side. His head was covered by
a red cap, and rich gold epaulets rested on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said this individual, addressing the new
comer in a low and pleasant tone, “I am happy to see
you back. Success, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Success,” answered Lorenzo briefly but courteously,
“I have three strangers there in the boat, of whom, pray,
order your watch to take care; the captain, I suppose
is in his cabin, so I shall see him by the dawn of day.
Good night, Sebastian, good watch.”</p>

<p>“Farewell,” answered the party addressed, and Lorenzo,
our former man at the stern, disappeared.</p>

<p>This short dialogue carried on, as it was, in an under
tone, scarcely broke the extraordinary silence which
reigned on board the mysterious schooner.</p>

<p>After Lorenzo had disappeared, Sebastian ordered his
men to take charge of the three prisoners in the canoe,
who were accordingly brought on deck. Jack Jimmy,
who after his fear had been lulled by the apparent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
harmless treatment of the Indians, had fallen fast asleep,
was the most struck when awakening, with the extraordinary
position in which he found himself suddenly placed.
When he got on deck, he stood as if his limbs would not
support him; he first looked aloft at the tapering masts of
the schooner, then on the deck, and when his eyes fell on
the men by whom he was surrounded, he opened his
mouth for an instant in mute amazement, and succeeded
at length to give expression to his terror in the words—“Garamighty!
way me be? Wha dish ya?”</p>

<p>“Softly, my little man,” said the sentinel, in a voice that
contrasted strangely with the weak shriek of the terror-stricken
Jack Jimmy, “we don’t speak so loud here.”</p>

<p>“Massa, me hush,” was the immediate answer of Jack
Jimmy, and he closed his lips as firmly as he could, as an
earnest of his determination to keep silence; but in the
dark the white of his eyes may have been seen revolving
from object to object with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p>“Follow this way,” said a man, who had received instructions
from the officer, to the prisoners; and he led
them down a narrow stair-case to a small cabin in the
foremost part of the vessel. “This is where you are to
sleep to-night,” said he to them, after they had been
ushered in: “do you require anything?”</p>

<p>The captives answered in the negative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” continued the man, “make yourselves comfortable
for the night, and be awake betimes to-morrow
to see our captain—he gets up early.”</p>

<p>He then posted himself at the door of the cabin, with
his cutlass in his hand, like one who was to pass the
whole night there. Not a sound more was heard on
board the schooner that night.</p>

<p>When morning had arrived, the prisoners were
brought on deck, and requested to be prepared to
appear before the captain immediately.</p>

<p>The strange vessel on board of which they found
themselves, could be better examined by daylight than
by the dim star-gleam of the preceding night. The
long level deck was scoured as white as snow; not a
speck, not a nail-head, not the minutest particle of anything
could be discovered upon it. The very seams
were filled up in such a manner, that the material which
made them impervious to water, imparted an appearance
of general cleanliness. The halliards were all
beautifully adjusted at the foot of each mast, and
made up for the moment in the shape of mats,
or other fanciful forms. The belaying pins, that were
lined with brass, were beautifully polished, while the
tapering masts were as clean and as smooth as ivory.
The arrangement of the deck, also, was exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
neat: nothing but a few beautiful and simple machines
for hoisting were to be seen, and in properly-disposed
recesses in the bulwarks, glimpses might be caught of
the rude instruments of destruction—of pikes that
looked horrible even in their places of rest,—axes whose
shining edges made the blood run chill, and grappling-irons,
whose tortuous and crooked prongs made the
nerves recoil with the thoughts of agony which they
brought up. An awning, as white as the deck which it
sheltered, was spread from the stem to the stern of the
schooner.</p>

<p>Men dressed and armed, as the sentinel of the preceding
evening, were leaning here and there, conversing
together in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>Of all these things, the one which particularly attracted
the attention of the strangers was the extraordinary
device that everything on board the schooner bore;
namely, a death’s head placed on the crossing of two
dead men’s bones. This was imprinted on the rigging
of the schooner, on its tackle, on the weapons which
were arranged in the bulwarks, and the men wore it in
front of their blood-red caps, and on their arms. This
strange circumstance had a powerful effect on the prisoners:
Jack Jimmy opened his mouth and eyes, and
seemed, on contemplating that sign, to devote himself to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
death already; and the master fisherman became still
more anxious than he had been from the first. He recollected
that in the various stories with which he and his
fellows in the same pursuit had beguiled many a tedious
hour, pirates were represented as always displaying a
black flag, on which the same sad mementoes of mortality,
as those which he saw everywhere on board the
schooner, were imprinted.</p>

<p>The thought immediately broke in upon him that he
might at that moment be among those lawless men,
about whose horrible cruelties he had heard so much,
and he shuddered at the reflection.</p>

<p>It is true he had not, up to that moment, experienced
any personal outrage or even incivility; but might he
not be reserved for those shocking tortures to which he
had heard pirates were accustomed to resort, for the
purpose of forcing their victims to the confession of
what was alike improbable and impossible? His reflections
now became gloomy and distressing; and thoughts
that rush upon a man only at his last moments, or in
situations of imminent danger, began now to force themselves
upon him.</p>

<p>This train of thoughts was broken by Lorenzo, who
suddenly emerged from the companion of the chief cabin
and approached him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Lorenzo presented quite a different appearance from
what he did under his Indian disguise of the day
before.</p>

<p>He was cleanly washed of the red ochre with which
he had painted his skin; it now appeared fresh and
clear, as it was by nature, although a little embronzed
by a tropical sun. His features, which could now be
properly read, expressed a character of manly firmness,
softened by much humanity and tenderness. He wore
the same dress as the officer whom he met on duty the
previous night, with the slight exception that his red
cap was more richly decorated. This seemed to
be a badge of distinction, and it could be at once
perceived from the manner in which he acted, that
Lorenzo was in high command on board the strange
schooner.</p>

<p>“The prisoners will not be wanted for half an hour,”
he said to the man on duty; “you may retire with
them.”</p>

<p>He then went back, and descended the stairs by
which he had ascended.</p>

<p>These stairs led to a wide passage in the main-deck
of the vessel, which extended from the stem to the door
of the main cabin: he turned to the right, and proceeded
to the part where that cabin was situated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>He passed by a number of doors and passages, but
proceeded straight down the one in which he was, until
he arrived at a certain door that stood immediately opposite
to him. He then touched a large skull of bronze
that grinned hideously on it; it instantly flew open, and
he stood before a tall, and full armed sentinel, who, immovable
as a statue, looked him fiercely in the eyes.</p>

<p>The officer, without uttering a word, presented the
index finger of his left hand, on which there was a large
ring, the sentinel quietly stepped aside, and he passed.</p>

<p>He made a few steps, and from another niche in the
passage another sentinel presented himself, he showed the
ring again and passed; he went further forward, and
was again met by another sentinel, he performed the
same ceremony, and he was also permitted to pass. He
went on and met several others, on whom the ring
had the same effect; at last, he arrived at a sort of antichamber,
where two black boys, in gorgeous attire, were
waiting.</p>

<p>They immediately bent their bodies to Lorenzo as he
advanced, and then stood ready to answer him any
question he should ask.</p>

<p>“Is your master at leisure, Bembo?” asked Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“He is, senor,” answered one of the boys.</p>

<p>“Say I am here, and desire audience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>The boy bent his body again and retired.</p>

<p>He immediately returned, and informed the officer
that his master desired him to enter, and conducted him
to a door.</p>

<p>The officer pressed a skull similar to that with which
the reader has already been made acquainted; the door
flew open, and he stood in a magnificent apartment, with
a young man before him.</p>

<p>The apartment into which Lorenzo had entered, was
vast and magnificent in its proportions; it was formed
of the whole of the after part of the schooner, and of its
entire width. It was richly though peculiarly decorated:
the sides, unlike the plain wainscoating of ships
in general, were made of the richest and most exquisitely
polished mahogany, upon which were elaborately
carved landscapes, in which nature was represented
principally in her most terrible aspect,—with volcanoes
belching forth their liquid fires; cataracts eating away
in their angry mood the rugged granite, over whose
uneven brows they were foamingly precipitated; inhospitable
mountains frowning on the solitary waves below,
that unheedingly lashed their base; chasms that yawned
as terrific as the cataclasm that might be supposed to
have formed them, and other subjects which blended the
magnificent with the terribly sublime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The precious metals were freely used to mark the
shades and other points in these highly wrought carvings,
so that the fire which the volcanoes sent forth was
cleverly represented by gold, the water by silver, and
so forth.</p>

<p>Large beads of gold surrounded each tableau, and
separated it from the next. On the skirting-boards at
the lower parts were carved palezotic creatures, that
held between their extended jaws large richly bound
volumes, which were secured by springs against the
rolling of the vessel.</p>

<p>The ceiling was decorated in the same peculiar
manner: the two sides of the celestial sphere were distinctly
represented, with the signs of the zodiac and the
constellations finished in a perfect style, and scrupulously
placed at the correct distances from each other.</p>

<p>The furniture was in exact keeping with this rich,
though strange style of decoration. Soft and velvetty
carpets covered the floor, or rather the deck; fanciful
ottomans, made in the shape of gigantic sea shells,
covered with crimson velvet, and decorated with pure
and solid gold, were placed here and there. Immense
globes of the earth and the heavens, mathematical
instruments of the largest size were carefully arranged,
and so effectually secured in their position, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
they could not be affected by the tossing of the schooner.
But what was particularly calculated to attract attention
among these various things was a gigantic telescope,
whose principal parts stood on a magnificent frame.
More than ordinary care seemed to be devoted to this
instrument, both to its construction and to its preservation,
for everything about it was exquisitely made
and polished.</p>

<p>The young man who stood before Lorenzo, may have
been about twenty-five years of age: he was tall and
slender, but infinitely well formed; his limbs were beautifully
proportioned and straight, and his hands were
almost femininely delicate, notwithstanding the close
construction of the bones, and the hard, wiry sinews,
which could be barely seen, now and then slightly swelling
the skin.</p>

<p>His complexion was of a very light olive, it showed a
mixture of blood, and proclaimed that the man was connected
with some dark race, and in the infinity of grades
in the population of Spanish America, he may have been
said to be of that which is commonly designated
Quadroon.</p>

<p>But the features of this femininely formed man were
in deep contrast with his make; they were handsome
to the extreme; but there was something in his large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
tropical eyes that seemed to possess the power of the
basilisk, and made it difficult to be supposed that any
man could meet their glance without feeling it.</p>

<p>This expression was increased by his lowering brows
that overshadowed his eyes, and indicated, at once, an
individual of much resolution; while his high aquiline
nose, compressed lips, and set jaws, pointed clearly to a
disposition that would undertake the most arduous and
hazardous things, and execute them with firmness in
spite of perils.</p>

<p>In brief, the most superficial observer might have read,
in the face of that young man, the existence of something
within, which was endowed with the power of controlling
the most headstrong and refractory,—of quelling
the most rebellious spirits.</p>

<p>It required not the discoveries of science to convince
men, at a glance of his features, that there was a power
in that mind which was reflected on his face, that wherever
he was he would be by the necessity of his own
mind—pre-eminent and uppermost; that men must,
unknowingly to themselves, obey him, and act as he
acted.</p>

<p>In addition to those animal attributes, the shape of his
head was what the most fastidious could but admire;
his forehead rose in the fullness of beautiful proportions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
while, at the same time, those skilled in reading others’
sculls would have declared that, with his high intellectual
development, he did not lack those necessary moral
accompaniments which the Creator, in his wisdom, has
providently bestowed for the proper use and regulation
of the former.</p>

<p>Withal, however, there might be discerned in the
lofty bearing and haughty mein of the young man a
stern and invincible pride.</p>

<p>The dress of our young hero was simple; he wore
trowsers of the finest and whitest materials, and a Moorish
jacket of crimson silk, with large and ample sleeves;
round his waist was folded a red silk sash, in which a
gilded poniard and pistols mounted with gold, were
stuck; his head was uncovered, and his black raven
locks flowed over his shoulders in wild and unrestrained
profusion.</p>

<p>When Lorenzo entered the cabin the young man
was standing by a table, on which lay open a richly
ornamented volume of “Bacon’s Novum Organum,”
with the books of “Aristotle’s Philosophy” by its side.</p>

<p>It was evident that he was making his morning meditation
on those learned tomes.</p>

<p>When Lorenzo entered the cabin he bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Lorenzo,” said the young man, still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
maintaining his high posture, and pointed an ottoman
to the visitor.</p>

<p>“Well, how have you fared?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, your excellency,” answered the officer, “I
have captured a fisherman with his two men, whom
I have brought on board for your especial examination.
I made my observations during the time that my men
were resting, and have to report, that there are several
deeply laden ships in the harbour, which, from all
appearances, are ready for sea, and will sail within a few
days. There seem to be prospects of a rich booty, with
very little work for our men. There are no ships of war
in the harbour. I have taken the marks and sizes of
the vessels, which you will find on this paper, so that
the fisherman may be accurately questioned. The
ship, about which your excellency especially instructed
me, is also in the harbour.” Then, with a low bow,
Lorenzo handed a paper to the young man.</p>

<p>“You have done well, Lorenzo,” the latter said, and
glanced over the paper for a short time, and, apparently,
possessing himself of the information it contained, laid
it by.</p>

<p>“Let your fisherman be brought, Lorenzo.”</p>

<p>The officer left the apartment for a time and returned,
shortly afterwards, with the fisherman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>The fisherman appeared bewildered by the grandeur
of the place, and could scarcely restrain his eyes from
wandering distractedly about.</p>

<p>The captain, after affording him some time to regain
himself, requested him to dismiss his fears, and assured
him that no harm should be done him if he spoke the
truth, and began to interrogate him.</p>

<p>“You know the Harbour of Port of Spain, do you not?”</p>

<p>“I do, senor,” replied the fisherman, “I fish in it
every day.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the ships that are there now?”</p>

<p>“Senor, I do not know their names, but I know they
are nearly all English.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the large ship that is anchored opposite
the banks of the Caroni?”</p>

<p>“Senor, as I have said before, not its name; but I
know that it belongs to a rich English merchant, and is
laden with sugar for Bristol.”</p>

<p>“Do you know when she is to sail?”</p>

<p>“Senor,” answered the fisherman, “not positively, but,
from her appearance, I should say she will sail in a day
or two.”</p>

<p>The young man proceeded in this manner and
examined the fisherman about all the vessels which
were reported in Lorenzo’s paper to be in the harbour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
but without, at the same time, receiving any more
definite information.</p>

<p>After the questioning was ended, he requested the
fisherman to be re-assured, and to fear nothing; he then
pressed a spring at his feet, and one of the black boys
appeared.</p>

<p>“Show this man on deck,” said the captain. The
fishermen was shown on deck, where the sentinel duly
received him.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said the young man, “by the chart of
this island, and, from my own experience, I know that
there are only two outlets from this gulf—the Serpent’s
and the Dragon’s Mouth. Ships but seldom go through
the Serpent’s Mouth, both, on account of its narrowness,
and its distance out of the course of those that may
be bound for England. It is, therefore, my opinion
that the ships, which are now about to sail, will pass
by the Dragon’s Mouth; that passage is fifty miles to
the north of this. It is my will that five men be sent
with this fisherman of yours, to watch the sailing of the
ships: go you, therefore, bear the token, and request
the officer of the watch to attend to this order. When
this is done, come you hither and let me know. It is
my will to let the men have pleasure to-day as they may
have work shortly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Lorenzo bowed and retired: he shortly returned and
informed the captain—as the reader must have already
discovered him to be—that his order was executed. The
captain asked no further questions, but, perhaps from the
habit of being always strictly and implicitly obeyed, he never
doubted but that things were done as he wished. Such,
too, was the discipline that seemed to reign on board of
the schooner, that scarcely five minutes elapsed before
preparations were made, and a boat, with the fisherman,
among others, was duly dispatched to do as the captain
commanded.</p>

<p>When the captain was informed that his orders were
executed, he pressed again the spring and the boy
appeared.</p>

<p>“Sound the gong,” he said: the boy bowed and
retired.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No sooner had the captain given the order, than
the whole schooner echoed with the deafening sounds
of a huge gong, whose noise was sufficient to rouse
the soundest sleeper in the lowest recesses of the
schooner.</p>

<p>The sounds seemed to possess the power of transforming
the vessel, where such quiet and silence a little
before had reigned, to a scene of unbounded revelry.
No sooner had they fallen on the ears of the grim and
bearded sailors, than shouts of joy and mirth burst forth
from the same men, who, but a short time before seemed
pressed by a paralizing power into discipline, order, and
the silence of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>The deck then suddenly became a scene of the liveliest
animation; small groups of men settled themselves
here and there, some to sing, others to dance, and others
again preferring less boisterous amusement, to listen to
the long stories of some weather-beaten son of Neptune.</p>

<p>The jolly songs of all nations, as sung by the different
denizens that formed the motley crew of the schooner,
rose upon the bosom of the silent gulf. The Spaniard
sang his animated oroco songs; the Llanero, who had
been seduced away from his native plains to seek as
arduous an existence on the boisterous element, chanted
the pastoral ditties with which he was accustomed to
break the monotony of many a live-long night on the
lonely Savanahs of South America; the Frenchman
rattled over his lively airs, and the jolly choruses of
merry England, too, were not unheard on board of the
Black Schooner.</p>

<p>The guitar here and there stimulated the Terpsichorean
powers of some heavy sailor, and the schooner rang
with the merry laugh of those who listened to the jokes
of some funny old tar. Nor were the joys of drinking
unfelt. Every sailor had his drinking can by his side,
and contentment might have been read on the rigid
features of every one as he quaffed the stimulating
liquor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>One of the chief subjects of attraction seemed to be
an old sailor, whose features proclaimed him a son of
distant England, while a deep scar on his forehead, and
the brown-baked hue of his face, pointed him out as one
who had seen service. He was entertaining those
around him with some of his adventures, and was, at the
same time, speaking in his native language, which was
understood by his hearers. Few, indeed, were the
tongues that those men did not know; the wheel of
fortune had turned them round and round in their day,
and had cast them into many a different place, and
there was scarcely a country in the world to which their
pursuits had not taken them.</p>

<p>“Yes, by G—d,” the old sailor was saying, “that ere
Llononois was the very devil. I remember when he
took Maracaybo,—a devil of a fight that was, and no
mistake,—three nights in the swamps without bread or
grog; I remember when we took that place, there was
a poor sinner that we suspected had some dibs. The
commodore seized him—devil of a man he was—‘Where
have you buried your money?’ Says he—says he—the
sinner, I mean, ‘I have no money,’ says he. Says the
commodore, says he, ‘you lie, you rascal, and I will
make you show me the coffers!’ He took the lubber—by
G—d I’ll never forget that day—not I: he took the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
lubber and tied a line round his head, just as if he would
season his head—as I would the main-shrouds—he tied
the line round his head, and took a hitch in it with a
marlin-spike, and twisted the line until you would ha’
swore it would cut the lubber’s head in two. The sinner
sang out murder, but the commodore twisted the more,
and asked him for the dibs. He said he had’nt any.
‘Have’nt any, you rascal?’ cried the commodore, in a
fury, and twisted the line tighter and tighter, until the
eyeballs of the lubber swelled like a rat in a barrel of
pork. Lord! I never seed the like—and Jim Splice has
seen many things, too, I can tell you—but he still said
he had no money. At last the commodore got angry—a
terrible man he was when he was not, leave alone when
he was—‘Where is your money?’ he cried, more like a
devil than a man. ‘I hav’nt any,’ the poor man cried, but
that would’nt do: the commodore took his sword,
opened the poor fellow’s breast, tore out his heart, and
bit it, telling the other Spaniards he would serve them
just in the same way if they did not give him all the
money they had. By G—d, I’ll never forget that, anyhow!
I never seed human flesh eaten afore that—Jim
Splice never did—it was too much for me, hearch!” and
the old sailor made a hideous grimace. “Yes: I was’nt
much longer with that ere Llononois after that, I know.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
He was a brave man, though, after all, but nothing like
our captain. There was a black day for him, however,
ay, ay: that ere gentleman aloft keeps a good watch, I
know, and he kept a sharp look out on that ere Llononois
especially, and had the windward of him in no time.
The unfortunate man was cast away afterwards among
the same Spaniards, whose hearts he said he would eat,
and had to skulk in the woods where he shortly afterwards
died of starvation: by G—d, yes, of starvation.”</p>

<p>“And serve him right, too,” the sailors unanimously
cried, “what was the use of killing a poor brute when
he could get nothing out of him?”</p>

<p>With such anecdotes as this Jim Splice diverted his
companions. But there was on board of the schooner
that day another subject, which contributed largely to
the merriment of the sailors. This was no less a
personage than Jack Jimmy. After the examination of
the master fisherman, he, together with his companions,
had been released from the custody under which they
had at first been placed on their arrival on board of the
schooner, and after having been admonished that if he
threw himself overboard again, as he had once done from the
fishing-boat, he would be quietly permitted to be drowned,
he was left at full liberty to range the deck at large.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
When, however, the revelry began, still feeling strange,
and fearing lest he should be in the way of the men, he
had carefully rolled himself up at the foot of the mainmast,
with his head supported by both his hands; and
his eyes, the white parts of which could be seen at an
extraordinary distance, eagerly fixed on the movements
of the sailors. He had sat for a considerable time quiet
and unobserved, merely giving vent now and then to
his wonder, when that was heightened by any astonishing
event in the day’s amusement, by a laconic—“Awh!
wha dish ya Baccra debble foo true—Garamighty! look
pan dem!”</p>

<p>When, however, the other things which had afforded
amusement to the sailors, began to pall; when the dancing
had become fatiguing, the songs had been exhausted,
and Jim Splice’s stories had lost part of their attraction,
the sailors began to look about for other excitement. It
was at this moment, an unhappy one for him, that their
eyes fell on the unfortunate Jack Jimmy: he was
observed in his crouching position, where it was difficult
to distinguish him from the ideal of a rolled up ouran-outan.</p>

<p>Struck with the peculiar comicality of the exhibition,
the first sailor that remarked him burst out into an
immoderate fit of laughter, and then touched his neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and pointed him out; the next did the same to his
companion, until all eyes were fixed on Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“What have we here?” cried a maudlin young sailor,
as he stood up and ran towards the object of attraction
the others immediately followed.</p>

<p>“Let us see what is in that fellow, mates.”</p>

<p>“Ho, the little prisoner!” rang among the merry
men.</p>

<p>Three or four of them immediately tapped him on the
head jocosely, and asked him to sing: Jack Jimmy
trembling with fear, opened his eyes and mouth at once,
“Massa, me no sabee sing,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Come, old boy! stand up—you must sing,” said one
of them, and they pulled up poor Jack Jimmy from his
recumbent position.</p>

<p>If the appearance of the little man was calculated to
raise laughter when he was crouching, it was much more
so when he was standing up; and really there was something
in him peculiarly comical. He was a little man of
about four feet and a half, thickly set, and strong; his
face was rounded at the mouth, and his long bony jaws projected
to an extraordinary length in front. He seemed
to have no brow, there was no distinction between his
face and forehead; his huge large eyes looked like balls
inserted into two large holes, bored on an even surface,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
while what was intended for a nose, was miserably
abbreviated and flat, added the culminating point to an
ugliness which was almost unique. To crown this
extraordinary combination, a short crop of scattered hair
grew on the top of his head, while the other parts were
bare and shining, and now stained a dirty white with
water.</p>

<p>Nature did not seem to have been generous enough to
accord to him one single redeeming point; his head was
joined by a short neck to square heavy shoulders, that
rose about the ears of the little man; his legs were of
the same shapeless proportions, and terminated at the
base in large lumps of flesh, which seen unconnectedly
with their appurtenant limbs, would scarcely have been
taken for feet, if the short, chubby, and creasing toes,
that were fixed to them, had not indicated their nature.
To add more to this already ridiculous figure, the circumstance
of dress was called in requisition. Jack
Jimmy was clad in a dirty, ragged, checked shirt; with
lower coverings that were once brown, but which were
now of an obscure tawny color, acquired from the many
incrustations of dirt that had been permitted to be
formed upon them. The sleeves of the shirt were
tucked up in a roll which seemed to have become perpetual
from the smooth waxing which friction had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
imparted to it. The tawny trousers were done up in
like manner; and on the lower exposed parts of the limbs,
might be traced on the black skin, the embedded salt
which had settled there while the water trickled down
after the plunge of the preceding day.</p>

<p>All these peculiarities, set forth in active prominence
by the fear and excitement of the present moment, were
quite sufficient to overcome the gravity of more serious
men than those who happened, at that time, to be at
the height of their merriment.</p>

<p>“Garamighty, massa! me tell you me no sabee sing.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can dance, then;” and one of the sailors
took a sword, and made so dexterously at the short legs
of the little man, that, to protect those members, he
began to jump about like a dancing puppet—to the
infinite gratification of the sailors, who roared with
laughter. This sport, however, soon ended.</p>

<p>“Hark ye!” said a sailor: “Sambo, if you can’t
sing, you must submit to a penalty—bring up the old jib,
Domingo,” he added to one of his mates, “or a blanket.”</p>

<p>“Yes, blanket him, ha! ha! ha!” cried all the men,
“blanket him, ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>With the alacrity that sport alone can give, the
sailors immediately brought a sail, into which they
lifted the unfortunate Jack Jimmy, who, stupid with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
fear, all the while was crying—“Tap, massa—Garamighty!—you
go kill me,—oh, Lard!—my mamee, oh!”</p>

<p>They raised him on the sail, and began to balance
him about, but Jack Jimmy, in the extremity of his
fear, apprehending that they were going to do something
dreadful to him, took a leap to get out of the sail, and
in doing so, was pitched flat on the deck.</p>

<p>He stretched himself out two or three times, feigning
the last convulsions of death, and lay at his length with
his eyes tightly closed. The sailors laughed; and, seeing
clearly, from the heavings of his chest, that he was
not so dead as he pretended to be, began to roll him
violently about, as they said, in keeping with his own
feint, to bring back life. But Jack Jimmy played his
part well, and would neither open his eyes, nor show
any other sign of existence.</p>

<p>At last, one of the sailors said, aloud—“I know what
will bring back the poor fellow: yes, it would be a pity
to let him die so; Jack, lend me your cigar.” Jack
lent his cigar, and the sailor applied the lighted part to
the thick great toe of the would-be defunct. He, however,
would not move, but the sailor was persevering;
Jack Jimmy remained quiet until the fire had fairly
burnt through the thick skin, and had touched the more
tender parts; when he felt it he was no longer dead;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
he sprang up briskly, on his resting part, and, catching
hold of the toe, rubbed it with all his might, while he cried
out—“Gad, Lard! me dead foo true;—wy—ee bun
me foo true—Garamighty!”</p>

<p>The merriment of the sailors was extreme; the
schooner rang with their protracted peals of laughter.
But while they were thus at the height of their pleasure,
the shrill sounds of a fife pierced the vessel; and as if
it were the death time of mirth and joviality; it was
succeeded by a silence, which can be imagined only,
where pestilence has ravaged a population, and has left
its gloom, even on the sickly trees and rocks that lay in
its devastating traces. It settled itself like a fear-inspiring
genius where, but a moment before, was naught
but boisterous mirth; the hour of pleasure was passed,
that of discipline and order had returned. One by one
the sailors retired to their quarters, lifting bodily, along
with them, such of their companions as had indulged too
extravagantly in the delights of drinking.</p>

<p>To a stranger, the change was extraordinary. It
would have been hard to believe, unless one had been
convinced by the testimony of his own eyes, that there
was a power so infinitely strong, as to control those,
apparently lawless men, in the height of their self-willed
pleasure; especially, when their spirits were heated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
strong drinks, and the fierce propensities of their
nature, were roused to a point when it was difficult to
restrain them; but such there appeared to be. What
was the spring, what the source, what the origin of that
extraordinary power? What had the man done, young,
as he seemed to be; and solitary, as he appeared, among
so many stronger men, to enable him thus powerfully to
impose the bonds of discipline, to recall and to sway a
number of such men in the midst of their boisterous
enjoyment? Was it the recollection of some dreadful
deed of firmness, still fresh in the minds and hearts of
those stern weather-beaten sailors, that sustained this
fear of their youthful captain, or was it the mysterious
influence of a curbing and omnipotent mind that chained
them to its volition, it is not our part to inquire; suffice
it to say, whatever the power, or however acquired, it
existed, and that it was strong enough to drive back
the sailors of the black schooner to the habitual discipline
and order that reigned on its board.</p>

<p>The night was far advanced when the boat, which had
been sent on the watching trip, returned.</p>

<p>Lorenzo was immediately informed that a large ship,
deeply laden, had passed the “Boca del Drago.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the officer, to the man who reported
these tidings, “you have done your duty faithfully, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
you have lost this day’s pleasure; mark it down and the
captain will not forget it. Get you to your quarters,
and to-morrow be early in my cabin—you may have to
appear before his excellency.”</p>

<p>The man made a bow and retired.</p>

<p>Morning, beautiful and clear, such as it is only in the
transparent regions of the tropics, had just come, when,
in obedience to the order of the preceding night, the
sailor returned to the cabin of Lorenzo. There he was
subjected to a more particular examination than the
leisure of the foregone night permitted, and he detailed,
with accuracy, the various little incidents which had
befallen him since he started from the schooner on his
commission.</p>

<p>“The ship,” he said, “is very large, and seems to be
well manned. There were several persons on board,
who appeared to be passengers. We pretended to be
fishing, and we pulled backwards and forwards under
her stern as she was sailing slowly before the light wind,
so that we had an opportunity of observing her closely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and of seeing that on her stern was marked the ‘Letitia’
of Bristol.”</p>

<p>“The ‘Letitia,’” repeated Lorenzo, and a gloom
passed over his countenance, as he remained for a minute
or two absorbed by some devouring thought.</p>

<p>“Did she seem to sail well?” at length, he asked.</p>

<p>“Senor, the wind was light, and we could not judge
of that; but, from her build, I think she would be a
clipper,” answered the man.</p>

<p>After Lorenzo had put some other questions to the
sailor he dismissed him, and requested that the master-fisherman
should be immediately brought. The latter
was, in a short time, conducted to the officer’s cabin,
where he was interrogated in the same manner. The
fisherman said it was the large ship which appertained
to the rich English merchant, and of which he had
already given information to the captain. The officer
dismissed him also, and sought, at once, the captain’s
cabin. He communicated the report of the party, and
in answer was ordered to go on deck, immediately, and
get ready to set sail. When Lorenzo was detailing to
his chief the report of the reconnoitring party, the
deepest physiognomist would not have been able to
discover a wrinkle or a mark in the face of the young
man, or to perceive the slightest change in his dark eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
that could indicate the existence of any particular feeling
within. He sat like a statue, as silent and as still, with
his piercing eyes fixed on the pupils of the narrator’s,
who, from time to time, was obliged to look down in
order to relieve himself of the torture in which he was
kept by the eagle glance of his chief. But when
Lorenzo arrived at the part of the report in which the
description of the vessel was made, and the name
“Letitia” was mentioned, there might be traced around
his lips the rudiments of a sardonic smile of triumph—something
like the flash of a ponderous cannon when a
match is applied in the darkness of night, that dazzles
for a moment, and then suddenly dies away in the thick
enshrouding smoke that darkly typifies the terrible
gloom of the destruction which springs from its midst.</p>

<p>Having heard the report of his officer, the captain
ordered him to proceed, at once, on deck, and get ready
to set sail. The officer bowed and retired.</p>

<p>When Lorenzo had quitted the cabin, the captain
remained sitting in the same position in which he had
received the report, and appeared occupied by some
preying thought.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he muttered, “‘Letitia,’ that is the name: he
goes in it. Speed well my purpose!”</p>

<p>The preparations on board the schooner did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
require much time to be completed, and, in a few
moments, the captain himself made his appearance on
deck. It would appear, that except when the schooner
was under weigh, he never showed himself to his crew.
Like the priests of yore, who swayed mankind, he was
no doubt apprehensive, that if he exhibited himself too
frequently to vulgar view, the sailors, in getting familiar
with his person, should lose much of the veneration and
awe which they unquestionably entertained for him, and
which seemed to crush their wills to an implicit and
blind obedience to his.</p>

<p>When he appeared on deck, he was attired in quite
a different fashion to the one in which he was seen in
his cabin. He wore black trowsers, with broad stripes
of gold on the sides, and a black frock coat, simply but
richly ornamented with embroidery of the same precious
metal. The red sash, as usual, was folded round his
waist, and supported the pistols and poniard; his head
was crowned with a flaming cap, in the front of which
was wrought the death’s head and dead men’s bones;
while, in addition to these things, a beautiful sword, with
gold mountings, hung by his side.</p>

<p>“Weigh,” he said, to the officer on duty, as his foot
touched the deck; the vessel was immediately put under
sail. The light breeze of the morning filled her well-trimmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
canvass, and like a creature of life and grace
the Black Schooner began to cut through the water.
Scarcely a ripple marked where her sharp keel passed,
as she moved gracefully over the quiet waters of the gulf.</p>

<p>The hills of the Bocas gradually arose more and more
distinctly before her, as she quickly approached them.
No scene perhaps in nature is more beautiful than the one
which presents itself to the mariner as he sails through
the narrow strait that affords a northern passage from
the Gulf of Paria.</p>

<p>Standing in the midst of the clearest waters that
bathe in graceful ripplings their luxuriant base, are
clusters of small islands that are carpeted to the very
beach with fresh and never fading verdure. Like a scene
in a panorama, or like the trembling shadows which a
tropical moon casts over the silent lake or placid stream,
those islands seem balancing over a crystal surface,
that shines and sends forth a thousand undulating
reflections under the pure and clear rays of an undarkened
tropical sun: or, as they recede to the eye,
in proportion to the progress of the vessel, imagination
might convert them into the terrestrial realities of those
variegated spots which the musing poet is fond to contemplate,
to follow in their course, to speculate and
dream upon, in the transparent and lulling pureness of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
summer sky. Above these are seen the blossoming coral-trees
with their scarlet flowers, that chequer the
densely wooded hills, and stand amidst the dense foliage
that surrounds them, marked and conspicuous like
thousands of growing wreaths, that administering
nymphs eternally offer to tropical nature in gratitude for
her marvellous and beautiful works.</p>

<p>Over the shining waters themselves that lave these
hills and fairy isles, are seen the long-necked pelican, in
its shadowy flight, or its fierce headlong plunge after its
watery prey; the spiry smoke, as it ascends from some
reed-constructed cottage on the shore; the feathery
canoe of some solitary fisherman, playing, like a child of
the element, on the beautiful sea; the crooked creeks
and receding bays that conjure up thoughts of lurking
pirates; the sullen growling of the ocean, in long, high,
and heaving swells, as it rolls on the ocean-side: all these
mark the entrance of the Boca with the boldest and most
beautiful features of natural beauty that fancy, in her
wildest reveries, can draw and paint; while the gloomily
ascending mountains of Paria, on the left side, with their
precipitous falls, to be seen far, far away;—mountains,
that stand dark and dismal like sulky lions on the crouch,
and seem ready to fall—to fill up the narrow straits
below, and to bury, far beneath their weight, the frail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
structure of fragile wood that intrudes with its rash and
venturesome burdens into the very shadow of their black
brow, tend to add to the scene a solemn and terrifying
effect.</p>

<p>The black schooner glided through the narrow outlet,
and rose outside on the boisterous billows of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>The captain paced the deck in deep reflection. His
dark eyebrows completely hid his eyes, which remained
fixed on the deck. Their long and silken lashes swept
the handsome young man’s cheeks, his lips were compressed,
and his black mustachios imparted a still
sterner, and more terrible appearance to his face. He
wore the aspect of one whose resolution was taken to do
a desperate deed, and whose nature still refused consent
and revolted at the thought, like him who sacrifices to
principle, and is doomed to drain a cup that makes
humanity shudder.</p>

<p>He had directed the schooner to be steered in the
course which the ships bound for England generally take,
and men were stationed on her tall and raking masts to
keep watch. The day passed: night came; still the
schooner held her course, and silence reigned on board.
Not a sound was heard, save when the shrill pipe called
to duty, or told the hour. The next day came, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
it the order to prepare for fight, still there was no vessel
in sight. But the captain was not one to give orders in
vain. He knew his vessel, he knew the currents, and
could tell the precise hour when he would overtake a
vessel of whose departure he was apprized.</p>

<p class="tb">The sun was just sinking in the horizon, when the
man aloft cried out—</p>

<p>“Sail, ho!—to leeward.”</p>

<p>The captain stopped, and ordered his telescope; with
that he discerned a speck in the distance, but far
away.</p>

<p>“Keep her away,” he cried, to the man who was
steering:—“ease your jib, foresail, and mainsail sheets,
Gregoire;”—to the officer on duty; and the schooner
edged off.</p>

<p>She sailed so fast that by midnight she was near the
object that had appeared in the horizon, and which was
now found to be a large ship gallantly careering over
the ocean. Her white canvass shone in the moonlight,
and the foam that gathered at her bows was brilliant
with the phosphorescence of the Caribean Sea.</p>

<p>“Take in the fore-sail,” the captain cried; and that
sail was immediately lowered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The sailors were now all armed with pistols, poniards,
and boarding pikes. As they stood grimly gazing on
the ship before them, their black beards, red caps, and
weapons, looked terribly dreadful, and the idea of some
bloody deed could not but be suggested by their
appearance.</p>

<p>The fife sounded a peculiar note, and all the sailors
gathered at the foot of the schooner’s mainmast. Here
may have been heard the low whisperings of comrade to
comrade: there may have been seen the fierce eyes of
some, flashing, as it were, in anticipation of something
congenial. Some may have been observed to stroke
their raven beards as if out of patience; others, leaned
carelessly on their pikes. When they had properly
formed, the captain stopped in his nervous walk, and,
drawing himself up to the full height of his lofty and
commanding person, said:—</p>

<p>“Associates, you have now another opportunity to
revenge yourselves on the world. There,” and he
pointed to the ship, “there you have the wealth of some
trader, that has neither capacity to enjoy it, nor heart
to use it. Remember how frequently you have wanted
the morsel which he could so easily have spared, but
which you never found. Remember your wrongs and
now redress them; take what the world would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
afford you. By the dawn of day we shall attack that
ship. I expect nothing less than that which I have
always found in you, give but your valour, and you
shall have the booty—the reward of bravery. Go, rest
yourselves until the morning.”</p>

<p>This short speech, he spoke in a clear, deep, and
sonorous voice; while the features of the speaker seemed
more eloquent than his tongue. The bitterest hatred
curled his lip, when he delivered the first part, and animation
glowed on his countenance, when he spoke of the
bravery of his men.</p>

<p>“Bravo! bravo!” broke out in loud and deep echoes
from the assembled crew. The sailors, one by one,
returned to the foremost part of the vessel, not without
having first cast an inquiring glance at the ship before
them. Some betook themselves to their hammocks, and
others sat together smoking their cigars and conversing,
in a low tone, on the probable events of the approaching
morning.</p>

<p>The night waned: and, at last, morning came.</p>

<p>The captain, who, after he had addressed his men,
had given orders to the officer of the watch to keep
the ship always in sight, but by no means to approach
her more closely, had descended into his cabin, now
re-appeared on deck. He walked up to the helm, looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
first at the compass, and then at the ship that was still
a-head of the schooner. The ship appeared now in all
her greatness. She was a large merchant-man, apparently,
deeply laden, but by no means an indifferent
sailer.</p>

<p>“Hoist the foresail,” the captain said, and the sail
was again put on the vessel, that seemed to feel it, for
she now leapt over the waves like a snake on whose
tail some passer-by had accidentally trodden.</p>

<p>“To your posts, my men,” the captain again said, and
the shrill fife re-echoed his command.</p>

<p>With the silence of death every man took his station,
every gun was manned, every halliard was attended to,
while the sides of the deck were immediately lined with
men, who were armed with pikes and axes in addition
to their pistols and poniards.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the rapidity and calmness
with which these preparations were made. We must
call to the assistance of our memory the movements of
beautifully adjusted machines as they perform their parts,
to form an adequate idea of the promptness and ease with
which the hundreds of men on board the Black Schooner,
executed their captain’s order.</p>

<p>The schooner now drew rapidly on the ship: she was
light, and was a fast sailer, and fully felt the light breeze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
which was blowing at that early part of the morning.
Not so with the ship pursued: deeply laden, and comparatively
heavy, the light air had scarcely any effect
upon her, and she was moving along but tardily. When
the schooner had arrived within gun-shot from the ship,
at the captain’s order, a gun was fired, and the broad
black ensign, with the frightful device of death, ran along
the signal-line.</p>

<p>The shot boomed athwart the ship’s bows, but she
paid no attention to the signal; on the contrary, additional
sails were immediately hoisted, and the vessel
was kept freer from the wind. But the schooner still
gained upon her.</p>

<p>The report of another cannon, from her side, echoed
over the waters: still the ship kept her course. The
captain spoke not a word, but looked with haughty
calmness on the large vessel, as he stood lofty and erect
on the deck, with his arms crossed over his breast.
“Launch and man the boats,” he said, after a long
space of time had been permitted to escape; a loud
cheer, which they could no longer suppress, burst forth
from the men. More quickly than we can describe, the
hatches were raised, and two boats were immediately
hoisted out into the water; twenty men cheerfully jumped
into each, and stood ready for the order to shove off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>The boats were towed at the sides until the captain’s
voice was heard—“Shove off and board,” he cried, in
the same composed and stern manner. A loud cheer
from the sailors in the boats, and their comrades on deck,
echoed the order. The boats leapt over the long waves
under the vigorous efforts of the men. They approached
the ship. They stood up, pike in hand, ready to climb
its sides.</p>

<p>“Pull, my men,” cried the officer in command, “we
take her at once:” a flash was seen on the ship’s deck,
a loud report was heard, and, as the smoke ascended,
the shattered remnant of the first boat were seen floating
here and there, and those who had been in it, and,
a moment before, had longed so eagerly for battle,
were scattered about on the water dead and horribly
mutilated.</p>

<p>The discharge from the ship told with a fatal exactness:
the gun, it would appear, had been loaded with
pieces of old iron, nails, and everything destructive that
could be found; and the charge swept away men and
boat with a dreadful crash.</p>

<p>“Lay on your oars, my mates,” cried the officer of
the second boat, fierce with anger at the destruction of
his comrades: and in a few seconds she was alongside
the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Board, board,”—quicker than thought the assailants
climbed the sides of the merchantman, but not to land on
deck: a dreadful conflict ensued. The men of the ship
resisted valiantly, like those who knew they were fighting
for their lives: the foremost assailants were dashed
into the deep. They slashed at each other—attacking
and attacked. The assailants handled their pikes with
fierce and unbreathing vigour, but they seemed to make
but little head against the men of the ship. Here and
there a boarder was to be seen, to hang to the ship for
a moment in his death-grasp, while blood and brain
gushed from his cloven head to balance a moment in
mid-air, and then fall heavily into the sea.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurrah!”—the cries of victory rose on
board the British vessel, as assailant after assailant was
precipitated into the deep, or sunk under the blows of
the men on deck. Now the survivors rushed, for security,
into the shrouds; now they clung to the ropes with teeth
and feet, while, with their pikes, they kept at bay the
opponents on deck. Like famished tigers, that would
have their morsel or die, they fought, falling, dying, and
almost dead: no shout, no word escaped them, but they
did their work in terrible silence. On, on, the English
sailors pressed. The shout of victory again rose; but
three of the assistants remained—they were partly sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
in the chains, and fierce as leopards at bay, they
felled all that dared approach them; their companions
were all cut down or driven over board; perspiration
ran down their brawny breasts; blood and foam
bubbled from their mouths; and, with eyes as dry and
lurid as the famished Panther, they slashed at their
hard pressing opponents. Suddenly a loud cheer was
heard; it rang over the ocean like the roar of a distant
cataract; the still resisting three heard it: a hoarse
cry came from their parched and husky throats.</p>

<p>“The ‘Periagua,’”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> one of them cried, and a long
canoe-like boat was seen rapidly approaching from the
schooner.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> <i>See</i> Appendix A.</p>
<p>[Transcriber’s Note: There isn’t an
Appendix A, either in this volume or in Volume 2. The term
‘periagua’ was originally used to describe the long, narrow
dugout canoes used in the Caribbean and in Central and South
America. By the date of this book, it was also applied to
small, flat-bottomed sailing vessels.]</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The captain of the schooner himself stood in the stern,
cool and collected, with determination marked on every
feature. The boat approached nearer and nearer—two
strokes more, and she was alongside.</p>

<p>“Now save yourselves or perish:” so saying, the
captain drew a plug from the bottom—the water gushed
in—the boat began to sink; with the courage of desperation,
the pirates sprang on to the sides of the vessel.
Their swords glittered in the air, their pikes were
worked with the rapidity of lightning, the shouts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the attacked, the yells of the pirates, the splash of the
killed, as they fell headlong into the deep, rose wild and
appalling on the ear.</p>

<p>The men of the ship received this new attack with
firmness: but they had already fought long; they began
to yield; their blows fell less rapidly.</p>

<p>“On—on!” cried the captain, and in a moment he
himself was on the deck. With a wild yell the pirates
followed. The men of the ship now cried for mercy:
but the slaughter went on. Revenge directed every
blow—every stroke carried death. The voice of the
chief was at last heard above the confusion and death-cries.</p>

<p>“Enough: spare and secure your prisoners.”</p>

<p>The word arrested the sword that was raised to deal
the last fatal blow, and stayed the pike that had destruction
on its point. Every pirate gnashed his teeth
because his vengeance was stopped—but who dared
disobey?</p>

<p>“Cut the halliards:” ’twas done; and the masts of
the ship in a moment stood bare, and she lay floating
like a log on the waves.</p>

<p>The deck was crimson and slippery with blood; the
sailors of the ship, that had defended her so bravely, lay
in heaps, dead and dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The commander of the merchantman himself was
stretched lifeless on the deck. He had rushed on the
captain of the pirates as soon as the latter had gained
the deck, and wielding with both hands a ponderous
sword, made such a blow at him as would have cut him
through; but by a slight movement the intended victim
escaped the stroke, and before the commander could
recover from the impetus of his own blow, the captain
pierced him to the heart with his poniard. Without a
groan he fell dead.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was captured, the captain issued
his orders to his men, that their wounded companions
should be properly attended to; and the boat which,
although it had been swamped, on account of its lightness,
had not sunk, should be secured.</p>

<p>These commands were immediately attended to. The
pirates forthwith picked up their disabled companions,
that still clung to the wrecks of the first boat: or those
who, as yet, grasped, in a desperate effort for life, the
lower riggings of the ship of which they had laid hold in
their fall from the bulwarks or the deck.</p>

<p>The hatches were raised, and they began to examine
the cargo. The captain himself, with two sturdy
sailors after him, descended the steps that led to the
cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Here were three persons apparently overcome with
terror. A man of about middle age leant on the
panelling of the cabin, with a long musket, surmounted
with a rusty bayonet, in his hands, which trembled so
much from extreme fear that they were utterly unable
to raise the weapon which they sustained. On the
floor lay a young lady in a swoon, while over her bent an
aged priest, anxiously awaiting the appearance of returning
animation.</p>

<p>“Mercy, mercy on us!” cried the first individual, as
the captain entered the cabin; “take our money; I
have gold there; yes, there is gold in my cabin: but,
for God’s sake, spare our lives: for the sake of my
children and my family, spare an aged man, whose blood
can avail you nothing,” and the suppliant fell on his
knees, still grasping the unavailing musket.</p>

<p>“Get up, man: kneel not to me,” said the captain,
indifferently. The voice struck the prostrate man like
an electric shock; with a sudden start he raised his
head, and gazed at the man before him.</p>

<p>“What voice was that?” he cried, and passed his
trembling hands over his brow; and like him who
labours, by one violent and forcible effort of the mind, to
recall a thousand widely distant events; or like him on
whom dawns the recollection of some long-passed, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
horrible deed, he remained fixed to the spot, with staring
eyes and fallen jaws. Again and again, he passed his
hands over his brow,—“it was her voice!—what do I
hear?—what do I see?—No, it cannot be—yet so like
her:—no—yes—yes;—it is—my son.” He started, like
one in frenzy, from the cabin floor, and rushed on the
pirate chief. The latter drew back.</p>

<p>“Keep away,” he said: “I am, indeed, your son!—secure
that man,” turning to his men; and, while giving
them this order, passed to the upper part of the cabin,
at the same time casting a look of the bitterest scorn
on him who had recognised him as his son.</p>

<p>So intent was the aged priest on watching the recovery
of the young lady under his care, that he did not even
raise his eyes from her face during the above unexpected
recognition of father and son. But when the captain
approached the object of his solicitude, he suddenly rose,
and, throwing himself at his feet, implored him, in the
most moving accents, to spare the innocence and honor
of the young and helpless lady.</p>

<p>The captain, with what could be construed into a
smile, bade him be re-assured.</p>

<p>“Fear not, old man,” he said, “for the innocence and
honor of any one on my account; I value my time
much, and cannot spare a moment of it, either to blight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
the innocence or rob the honor of damsels;—continue
your attention to the young lady.” He then walked up
to the seat at the top of the cabin table, and deliberately
and coolly sitting down, ordered his men to search for
the ship’s papers and bring them to him.</p>

<p>There was not much difficulty in discovering these,
for the steward, who had carefully concealed himself in
his pantry during the attack, seeing that there was no
longer any bloodshed, now crept out of his hiding-place,
and offered his services to the searching pirates, on condition
that his life should be spared. By means of his
assistance, the papers of the captured vessel were
immediately rummaged out, and handed to the pirate
captain.</p>

<p>He glanced over them for a time, and at length
musingly said, as if speaking to himself,—“The owners
are rich, and they can afford to yield up this cargo to
better men than themselves.” He then delivered the
papers to one of his men, and ordered the passengers’
luggage to be searched. In the trunks of these were
found large sums in doubloons and other gold coins,—money
that had, no doubt, been destined to the buying
of many a European luxury.</p>

<p>The search went on; and when the cabin had been
completely rifled of every thing that was valuable, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
captain proceeded on deck, and was followed by his men,
and the passengers, who were now prisoners.</p>

<p>The pirates had, by this time, thoroughly examined
the cargo of the vessel, and had found it to consist principally
of the staple productions of the West Indies—sugar
and rum—together with a small quantity of other
minor commodities, such as tobacco and indigo. A
great portion of these light things was already collected
on the deck, where the pirates were assembled, waiting
for their chief.</p>

<p>“What has she?” inquired this personage, when he
gained the deck.</p>

<p>“Sugar and rum, your excellency,” one of the officers
answered, and remained in silence before his superior,
awaiting his orders.</p>

<p>The captain seemed to consider awhile, and then
replied: “Stay here, and retain a man with you.”</p>

<p>The men were immediately ordered to get the boats
ready to shove off to the schooner. Whatever light
things the pirates could stow away were put into them.
The wounded of their party were carefully lowered, from
the decks of the captured ship, into the boats. The
sailors of the ship, that had survived the action, were
placed in the bows of the Periagua; and the prisoners,
who, with the exception of the individual who had recognized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the captain as his son, were without restraint,
permitted to sit in the stern-sheets with the captain;
and the young lady, who had now recovered from her
fainting sickness, received all the attentions which the
most perfect civility could offer, and which were evidently
shown with the purpose of smoothing down the strange
position in which she found herself. The boats were
pushed off from the ship, that was left, sluggishly
rolling on the waves, under the charge of the two
men.</p>

<p>The pirates shortly gained the schooner, which,
during and after the action, continued to lie to the
wind, at a short distance from the prize.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, in whose command she was left, when the
captain headed the party of the Periagua, stood ready
at the gangway to receive his superior. No noise was
heard on board of the captured ship or the schooner
since the fight: the bonds of the same marvellous
discipline seemed, unknowingly to themselves, to control
the pirates, even at the moment of victory and
exultation; but when the boats came alongside the
schooner, human nature, it would appear, refused to
contain itself any longer: and those fierce men, who had
abandoned the entire world for the narrow space of their
small vessel, and the inhabitants of the vast universe for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the few kindred spirits who were their associates—that
had separated themselves, by their deeds, from the
world, the world’s sympathy, and the world’s good and
bad, that had actually turned their hand against all
men, and had expected, as they had probably frequently
experienced, that the hand of all men should be turned
against them, could not restrain their feelings of welcome,
and three loud and prolonged cheers resounded,
far and wide over the silent ocean, as they were wafted,
in undying echoes, over the crests of the heavy and
heaving billows. As comrade rejoined comrade, their
grim and bearded faces appeared to relax from their
wonted habit of ferocity, under the influence of a
prevailing sense of joy: such a joy, those, alone, can
experience who have seen every natural tie break
asunder around them—who have felt the heavy hand of
a crushing destiny, or have been hunted and driven, by
the injustice and persecution of friend or relative, to
seek shelter in that desperate solitude, which is relieved,
but, by the presence, and cheered, but, by the sympathy
of the few, who, like themselves, have been picked
out by fate, to suffer, to be miserable, and to be finally,
cast forth from the society of mankind.</p>

<p>The captain endeavoured not to restrain the joy of
his men; but he sat stern, collected, and unaffected as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
ever, in the stern-sheets of the boat. No sign of pleasure
or displeasure was written on his features: but if any
change could be read, it was the passing shadow of a
deep melancholy that rested, for a moment, on his
resolute brow. Perhaps the reminiscences of some bygone
period were playing on his memory; perhaps the
recollection of other days led him, in imagination, to
some cherished spot, where he was wont to hear the
joyful greetings of parent, friend, or lover. Perhaps the
remembrance of that one moment, when, even the most
unhappy, and the most perverse of men, feel for once,
the soothing influence of those mysterious feelings of our
nature, that melt, that soften, that gladden, and remain
for ever in our recollection, the lonely stars of comfort
in the heavy darkness of misfortunes. Perhaps the
remembrance of such a moment, now flitted across the
memory of the pirate captain.</p>

<p>Whatever was the feeling that cast its hue over his
brow, like the passing shadow of a fleeting cloud, it
came—in the twinkling of an eye, it passed away; and
he remained, again, the inscrutable individual, that he
ever was.</p>

<p>The captain, on gaining the deck of the schooner,
ordered that the prisoners should be properly treated:
“Let, however, that man,” pointing to the person who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
had recognized him as his son, “be kept in close
custody.”</p>

<p>Having said this, he looked around him on the
schooner, where the same order reigned as before the
attack, and went down into his cabin.</p>

<p>The day was now nearly spent, the sun was setting
red, round, and fiery, as it sets only in the tropics.</p>

<p>The light goods, which the pirates had brought with
them from the captured ship, and the prisoners, were
transhipped into the schooner. The boats were hoisted
into their places. The schooner herself lay in the
same position—motionless, under its counteracting
sails.</p>

<p>Some time had already elapsed since the captain went
below, and no orders had, as yet, been given for the
night. The officer, whose watch it was, walked the
deck in anxious expectation of commands.</p>

<p>The captured ship rolled at some distance from the
schooner, and it was apparent that it was necessary to
provide for her safety during the night that was now
setting in.</p>

<p>The short tropical twilight had nearly passed away,
and darkness was gathering on the expanse of the waters,
when one of the negro boys, whom the reader may
recollect, sought the cabin of the chief officer, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
delivered to him the same ring by which, it may be
remembered, he, once before, gained admittance into the
captain’s cabin. As soon as Lorenzo received the ring,
he proceeded to the after part of the vessel and gained
admittance to his chief.</p>

<p>The latter was still in his dark uniform and was sitting
by the large table that occupied the centre of the
apartment. A chart was before him; by its side
were, also, the papers which had been brought from
the ship.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said the chief to the officer, after pointing
to one of the ottomans, “it is my will that our prize be
manned, and sailed to St. Thomas, where we shall sell
the cargo. To-morrow, we shall deal with our prisoners,
and divide the spoils already gathered. Let a sufficient
number of men be sent on board the ship to-night, so
that she may be properly manned, in case of any
change of the weather. Let the schooner, in the mean
time, be kept lying to, under her jib; and let the prize
remain in the same position—a quarter of a mile from
us. At dawn of day, let all the men assemble on the
main deck, and wait for me.”</p>

<p>The officer rose and bowed, to depart.</p>

<p>“Stop, Lorenzo,” resumed the chief, “drink some
wine:” a spring was pressed, and immediately one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the boys in attendance brought in a richly cut decanter
and the necessary accompaniments. Lorenzo and the
captain, respectively, filled themselves a goblet and
quaffed it off in silence; after which the officer left the
cabin.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Obedient to the commands of his chief, Lorenzo
drafted a number of men from the crew, and sent them
on board the prize ship. The Black Schooner was kept
in the position ordered by the captain; the proper
watches for the night were set, and those on board the
vessel retired to rest.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the next day, a peculiar sound of the
fife summoned forth the whole crew of the schooner.
In the space of a few moments, above three hundred
men lined the long deck.</p>

<p>With the habit of continual discipline, they fell into
order so quietly, that the space afforded by the deck of
that comparatively small vessel, did not for a moment
seem filled by the multitude which gathered on it. The
pirates stood accoutred in, what might be called, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
holiday dress. Their red woollen shirts and caps were
worn with some care; their sashes seemed more
symmetrically folded round their waists, and the weapons
which were stuck in them, seemed adjusted with more
than ordinary attention; while their black beards, faces,
and hands, presented that clean, sun-burnt, half-sea,
half-land appearance, which we easily discover in the
aspect of a sailor while on shore.</p>

<p>The appearance of the crew, as it gathered that
morning, contrasted in a striking manner with that
which it wore before the attack.</p>

<p>Before the action, the pirates stood like men who
were too much engrossed with one idea—one passion—to
be capable of any thought which was unconnected with
that. Their red caps were drawn carelessly over their
heads; their dress was that of men who could not afford
a moment’s time to its adjustment, while the wildest
ferocity sat on every line of their countenances. On
that morning the absorption of mind had ceased; they
seemed returned from the engrossing contemplation of
the sanguinary and the terrible, to the softer feelings
that lend to life those charms, which, empty though
they be, still are sufficient to enliven its monotony, and
sometimes even to smooth down its asperities. Their
habitual fierceness, too, had yielded to the contentment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
by which they seemed animated, and their features
were less rigid, and less ferocious.</p>

<p>The men had been assembled some time before the
captain made his appearance: the change which was
observed in their aspect, could not be read in his. He
appeared the same, sternly collected, individual that he
always was.</p>

<p>As soon as he appeared on deck, the officers respectfully
bowed. The captain then seated himself on a
deck-stool, which had been placed behind a small table
for him. The boys, who always attended him, then
deposited on the table several bags of money, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“My men,” he said, when he had been seated, “our
booty in gold has been small, but we shall, no doubt,
find a sufficient recompense for our toil in the purchase-money
of the ship’s cargo, which it is my will to take to
St. Thomas’ to sell. Six thousand and five hundred
dollars is the amount of what we have got. This I shall
divide among you, and forego my own share until a day
of better fortune. Let the wounded approach.”</p>

<p>Those who had been but slightly wounded in the last
engagement, and could bear the fatigue of walking,
stepped forward. They received shares larger than
those of their comrades in proportion to the injuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
which they had sustained. Those who had lost a hand,
an arm, a leg, or a foot, received four times the amount
of booty; those who had lost an eye, a finger, or a toe,
received twice the amount. When the wounded had
duly been recompensed, the captain then addressed
his men.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” he said, “it was our misfortune to lose
some of our brave associates in the fight, let those who
were the friends of the dead come forward, as I call
over their names, and receive their share:—Diego—who
is Diego’s friend?” One of the pirates stepped
forward, and, raising his right hand, declared that he
was Diego’s friend. The share which should have been
that of the dead, was then delivered to his friend.</p>

<p>“Martin,” continued the chief, “who was Martin’s
friend?” Another pirate stepped forward, and, raising
his right hand, in the same manner, declared that he
was Martin’s friend.</p>

<p>The captain went on in this manner, calling over the
names of the lost comrades, and requiring to know their
friends, until he came to the last of the men.</p>

<p>“Francis,” he cried, “Francis’s friend.” Two men
simultaneously stepped forward, and, raising their hands,
each declared that he was Francis’s friend. “How is
this?” the captain asked, “it is not impossible to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
more than one friend, but you know, my men, that it is
the custom, on board this schooner, to have but one man
to whom his friend may bequeath his share?”</p>

<p>The men then looked at each other: and each looked
round at his comrades, as if appealing to them in testimony
of his right to be considered the friend of the
dead Francis.</p>

<p>“He was my friend,” each said, and looked again at
their comrades, in corroboration of his claim; but the
pirates uttered not a word in answer to this silent
appeal.</p>

<p>“My men,” said the captain, “this has never happened
here before: either Francis forgot his honor,
when he charged both of you to be his friends, when
dead, or one of you forgets his, when he asserts that he
is Francis’s friend. Now, Francis is no more, and cannot
answer for this; the responsibility of this breach of
honor, my men, rests, therefore, upon you: one of you
must lie.” The two men looked fierce when the chief
coolly pronounced this word. “You know the law—choose
your weapons—at six o’clock this evening you must
fight: the survivor shall receive the share of Francis.”</p>

<p>A low murmur of approbation rang along the line of
the assembled sailors, and the two pretenders to the
favour of the departed pirate stepped aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>After the shares of the wounded had been duly
allotted, and those of the dead scrupulously delivered
into the hands of their friends; or, if there were no
friends of the deceased, carefully set apart for the purpose
of having masses said for them, the lots of the other
pirates were shared out to them.</p>

<p>The officers of the schooner received theirs first, and
those who might be called the common seamen, theirs
afterwards. When the distribution was completed, the
prisoners and strangers on board were ordered to appear.
First came the surviving sailors of the prize ship. Out
of the complement of thirty-five men, who had formed
the crew of that vessel, five only had escaped death in
the engagement. These came forth, pale and haggard,
expecting, apparently, to hear every moment the dreadful
command which, in some horrible way, should put an
end to their existence. The five English sailors, with
the exception of one, whose years might be more mature,
were in the prime of life, and wore that hue of health
which their calling imparts: howbeit the anxiety of
the position in which they were placed had had its
temporary effect on them.</p>

<p>They approached the captain with an air of uneasiness,
turning their hats about in their brawny hands, while
divers bumps might have been observed to rise now and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
then, and disappear immediately on their weather
beaten cheeks: probably they were the various protrusions
created by the quid, while it went through the
many revolutions in which it was then twisted.</p>

<p>“What were your wages, by the month, men?”
inquired the captain, when the English sailors stood
before him, bending on them, at the same time, one of
his searching and stern looks.</p>

<p>The sailors looked at each other, then at the captain,
and then at each other again, and could not, apparently,
be bold enough to reply, lest the question might, eventually,
prove to be some trap by which it was intended
to ensnare them into some confession or other that would
tend to aggravate their sufferings. The captain neither
showed signs of impatience nor renewed his question,
but remained still, looking stedfastly on the sailors,
with the cool composure of one who does not wonder
that others should feel embarrassed in his presence;
but, on the contrary, expects a degree of confusion
on the part of those who are addressed by him. The
oldest man of the five, however, at last spoke and
answered:</p>

<p>“Three pounds a month, your honor,” raising his
hand, at the same time, to the part of his head where
the brim of his hat should have been, if that necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
cerebral protection had happened to be in its proper
place at the time, and not in his hands.</p>

<p>“Have any of you received any advances on your
wages?” again inquired the captain.</p>

<p>“Half of a months’ wages have been paid at home,
your honor,” answered the old tar, of which answer,
when he had duly delivered himself, he looked anxiously
round at his four companions respectively, and seemed
to inquire, “what will this lead to?”</p>

<p>The captain drew from a purse several pieces of gold,
which, when he had divided into several small sums, he
gave to the sailors.</p>

<p>“There are your wages,” he said, as he tendered the
money to them, “for the five months that you have been
on the voyage, we give, and do not take from such as
you.”</p>

<p>The sailors looked bewildered. They could scarcely
believe their ears, and they cast glances of amazement
at each other. Even the appearance of money, it would
appear, could not re-assure them; they put out their
hands to receive the tendered wages like men who were
afraid to receive something that was given lest danger
should be attached to it.</p>

<p>“We shall land you on the nearest head-land,” continued
the captain, “in the mean time, you may enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
your liberty. If any of you wish to join my men, you
can do so. The rules of the ship are few: I require but
one thing—obedience. Death is the penalty of the
least breach of discipline.”</p>

<p>Having said this, the captain waved his hand, and the
English sailors fell back behind the assembled crew.</p>

<p>The master fisherman and his men were next brought
forward. They had by this time become perfectly at
home in the schooner. The master fisherman found
that the life, which he would be likely to lead on board
would suit his Spanish blood, and Spanish character,
well. Down to that time, also, he had been well treated.</p>

<p>It is true, the discipline of the schooner had appeared
to him, accustomed as he was to the free and independent
life of one of his calling, rather hard and unbearable;
but the good companionship, and the profits of a pirate’s
life were sufficient, in his estimation, to outweigh that
inconvenience. As for Jack Jimmy, and his other man,
they, too, had familiarized themselves with their position:
the latter seemed to care but for little, in this
world, beside the luxury of eating, drinking, and sleeping.
He found the schooner capable of furnishing him
with those three things, and was not, therefore inclined,
like the generality of mortals, to grumble about more, when
he already enjoyed the three elements of his happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>The former, Jack Jimmy, it is true, was of a less
contented, and more restless disposition; and the order
and monotony of the schooner, to say nothing of the
continual fear in which he had at first been kept, by the
mystery of his novel position, tended to make him long
for his own cabin; or, at best, for any other situation
but the one in which he was then placed. He became,
however, by degrees more satisfied, the longer he
remained in the schooner; for, he was not ill-treated in
the first place, and the tricks which the men played
upon him, the voyage, and the other things—except,
perhaps, the fight—which had happened since his arrival
on board, contributed, in the second place, to afford that
excitement which, it would seem, his nature craved.</p>

<p>As the master fisherman appeared, the captain
delivered to him a purse, and said:</p>

<p>“That will compensate you for the time you have
lost: you will be landed soon, you, and your men.”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy had followed his master, or rather had been
thrust forward with him, in a state of nervous trepidation.
The movements of the little negro were as brisk
and as rapid as those of a monkey. His head turned on
his shoulders like a weather gauge in a storm, while his
large white eyes were stretched open to their utmost
width. His head seemed to be turned forwards, sideways,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and backwards at the same time. One would
have said that while he looked before him, he was afraid
he should be struck backwards, or sideways; while he
looked sideways, that he should be struck either from
before or behind; and while he looked backwards, he
was afraid that he should be struck from before or from
the side.</p>

<p>He was going on thus, like an automaton in violent
action, when the sound of the captain’s voice fell upon
his ear. He seemed, at that moment, struck motionless.
He fixed his eyes on him, lowered what supplied
the place of eyebrows, opened his mouth, threw his
head and neck as far forwards as he could, and remained
rooted to the spot in deep examination of the young man
before him.</p>

<p>This did not last long; for, with his, usually rapid
movements, he threw himself at the foot of the captain,
before he had quite finished the few words which he had
addressed to the master fisherman, clasped his knees
franticly in his arms, and yelled out,—“Garamighty!
da ee—da ee—da me young massa.”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy sobbed aloud, as he the more tightly
clasped the knees of the captain. The latter looked down
calmly and coolly on the little man, seemed to recognize
him, but said not a word to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>Pained by the apparent forgetfulness of his young
master, he raised his head, and, looking imploringly up
to the captain Jack Jimmy cried out, piteously:</p>

<p>“You no know me—you no know me, massa—you
no know Jack Jimmy—you no ’member Jack Jimmy
in de mule-pen—you—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do recollect you, Jack Jimmy,” interrupted
the captain, “but you must neither make such a noise
here, nor continue where you are.” He made a sign
with his hand, and two men stepped forward and led
away the affectionate Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Ah! my young massa,” continued the affectionate
negro as he was taken away, “ee bin da gie me cake—he
bin da gie me grog—an when dey bin want foo beat
me ee bin da beg foo me.”</p>

<p>When Jack Jimmy had been led away behind the
assembled crew, and had been prevailed upon to become
silent, which change did not take place in him until he
had been threatened to be again rocked in the sail,
the priest and the young lady were, in their turn, led
forth. The former, although it was perceptible that he
anticipated the gloomiest results, still had a resigned and
serene air. He looked calmly on all that had taken
place that day, and, perhaps, there might be read in his
eyes a certain expression of surprise, that the pirates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
did not at once act with that blood-thirsty ruffianism
which he had been accustomed, from his earliest schoolboy
readings, to attach to men of that abandoned
life.</p>

<p>The young lady was, naturally, much more affected
by the circumstances of her situation; kindness, however,
had not been spared to reconcile her to it as much
as possible.</p>

<p>Lorenzo had been strictly enjoined to show all marks
of attention to her; and he seemed not to have required
the positive command of his chief to do so: for she had
at her command the chivalrous devotedness, which great
beauty always draws from even the most stoical of men.
She was exceedingly beautiful; such a species of beauty
that we meet only in the tropics,—a beauty which we
can compare to no known standard: something that
belongs entirely to the warm clime by which it is produced;
something that is more of the fanciful than of
the real. She was of a middle age, slender, and of a
perfect figure; her features were delicately and nicely
chiselled; her complexion was of the clearest white,
tinged with the slightest olive; her dark brown hair
hung over a high and nicely moulded forehead, while
her dark gazelle-like eyes imparted to her face a character
of tenderness and softness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>The officer had exhibited the greatest solicitude on
behalf of the fair captive from the moment she came on
board the schooner; and now, when she stood on deck,
weak and nervous, he might have been observed, from
time to time, stealthily to give her as much assistance
as the rules of the vessel permitted, and to pay her,
perhaps, more attention than even the commands
of his chief could have been intended to require
of him.</p>

<p>When the priest and young lady stood before the
captain, he spoke but very few words to them.</p>

<p>“You will be landed,” he said, as he looked at the
two persons, “with the others, on the nearest cape.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and the captives were led away.</p>

<p>Lastly, the man who was found in the cabin of the
captured ship, armed with a musket, and who had
called the captain his son, was then led forward.
Unlike the other prisoners, he was strictly guarded, and
seemed to be treated with a severity that was the very
opposite of that moderation which had been so generally
and unexpectedly shown to the other prisoners that
were in the same situation with himself.</p>

<p>The captain cast a stern and penetrating look on him,
as he was brought before him, and said, in his stern
indifferent manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“Prepare, to-morrow, for your trial; you know your
crime.” As he said this, he waved his hand.</p>

<p>The prisoner seemed tongue-tied for awhile, his countenance
betrayed the most despondent fear; he seemed
to become conscious, at once, of some great offence,
under whose weighty recollection his whole faculties
appeared overwhelmed.</p>

<p>He stood before him whom he called his son, and
seemed to entertain for him more fear than any of the
stranger prisoners who could claim no relationship or
parentage to move his pity or secure his forbearance.
He could not utter a word for the short moment that
he stood before the captain, but when the pirates, who
guarded him, laid their hands roughly upon him, to pull
him away, the fear, the surprise, the consciousness
which, till then, had deprived him of speech, lost their
power under the influence of the terror that now
seized him.</p>

<p>“But—what—what is my offence? how dare you?
My own son, to—” here one of the sailors, who guarded
him, threw his sash over his head, and bound it so
tightly behind, that not even a murmur of the unfortunate
prisoner could be heard, as he was led away to
the foremost part of the vessel.</p>

<p>The chief now rose and retired. The crew silently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
returned to their own quarters, and the Black Schooner
which, a moment ago, was full of animation, was now
left again quiet and apparently solitary, gracefully
riding over the sparkling waves under her jib and half-mainsail.</p>

<p>The captain had retired from the deck of the schooner
but a short time, when the sounds of the gong, which
was the usual instrument for announcing a day of
pleasure to the sailors, echoed over the vessel. The
sounds were received with joy, and, in a short time, the
deck of the schooner again presented the scene of life,
which it had done but a few moments ago, but which
had been momentarily succeeded by the contrasting
stillness of death.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, the sailors were not standing
in the stiff restraint of discipline and duty, as then,
but they delivered themselves up to enjoyment with all
that impetuosity of pleasure, which strict constraint
and proper separation of relaxation from labour necessarily
produce. No boisterous mirth, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
obtained among them now, as on the other day. They
were occupied in either speaking about the prize-ship,
and the prospect of their booty, or in speculating upon
the enjoyment which their share of the mornings’ division
would procure them, when they should be allowed
a day’s sport in some friendly harbour. The liquors,
which they had taken on board of the ship, circulated
freely around, and the choice tobacco which had also
fallen into their hands, contributed largely to their
gratification.</p>

<p>The English sailors, who had been induced to make
themselves easy by the forbearance with which they
were treated, and had been invited by the pirates to
mix in the merriment, joined freely in the carousals of
the day. By that mysterious sympathy which instinctively
exists between people of the same country, and
children of the same soil, they had been drawn together
around Jim Splice, and were now expressing their
surprise at what they had seen, and experienced on
board the Black Schooner.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, shipmates,” said Jim Splice, in answer to
them, “you have come from a far country, hav’nt you?
ha, ha! you thought you were done for, eh? when you
saw our pikes, and our skull and bones; ha, ha! my
hearties, you did’nt know us: and, when you came on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
board, you expected to be made to walk the plank, eh?
We don’t look for men’s lives—what booty does that
give? we look for something better; and if you, or that
stupid skipper of yours was’nt foolish enough to fire
upon us, why, we would have taken your money and
your ship, to be sure, but those comrades of yours, that
have now gone to their reckoning, would be here now,
to take a glass of grog with old Jim Splice. But, by
G—d, that was a reg’lar rattler that you gave the first
boat—I never seed the like. It was foolish, though;
what could your skipper gain by that?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied one of the sailors, “you see we had
but one gun to fire salutes with, and our skipper had it
loaded with all kind of material, and pointed it himself.
He thought, you see, you would have cut away after
the first discharge, you see.”</p>

<p>“Then, by G—d,” replied Jim Splice, “he counted
without his host, my hearty; no one has ever seen the
stern of this here Black Schooner,” striking the deck on
which he sat, with his hand, “as is commanded by that
ere captain you spoke to this morning; and you may
take my word for that, I know. That man that you
saw this morning, I tell you, is the very devil, when
his blood is up; he fights like a tiger—a reg’lar
tiger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“But, who is that old lubber that looked so miserable
this morning—him who was guarded?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know much of him,” answered one of the
sailors, “but I have heard our captain say that he was
a rich old codger. I know he sent on board as many
hens and sheep as would keep us on fresh provisions all
the voyage if it had’nt so happened as we were taken.
But why was he guarded that way?”</p>

<p>“Hum—no one knows,” replied Splice, “I guess
there is some misunderstanding between him and our
captain; if so, God help him! for those who have misunderstandings
with our fire-eater never get on well, I
know; old Jim Splice would’nt be in that lubber’s
ducks for the richest West Indiaman that ever carried
sugar, I know.”</p>

<p>Here Jim Splice remained silent for a few moments,
during which time he seemed to be wrapt in serious
reflection.</p>

<p>“By G—d,” he continued, “I was saying, yes—yes—I
saw him once—ay, our captain, punish a shipmate
that had’nt obeyed orders, and I sha’nt forget that, I
know. Those that sail well with our captain are treated
like his children, but God help those who cross him in
his tack, all young and quiet as you see him!”</p>

<p>Splice became again silent, and looked absorbed, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
if his memory was returning to some bygone scene in
his chequered life.</p>

<p>“But, my hearties,” he said, when he had been silent
for a considerable time, “will you go ashore, or remain
with us? This is the schooner for any man of spirit;
by G—d! I should’nt leave this ere craft if they would
give me the finest palace to-morrow. Here we lead the
lives of men—ay, tough brave men—ay, no lubberly
coxcomb to make us jump about, or talk to us in oaths,
by G—d, no. Every man here is a man; he has only
to observe discipline, that’s all, no mistake there, my
boys; overboard with any one who does’nt keep the
rules—ay, this is the craft, my hearties. But what is
the matter there?” as he said this, he pointed towards
the bows of the vessel, where three men were standing,
and seemed to be objects of attraction to all the other
pirates, for the eyes of the whole crew were turned
towards them. “Ah! I see,” observed Jim Splice,
“it is my two shipmates of this morning, that are going
to fight it out. That’s a bad business: we never see
things of this sort on board this here craft; two men
never claim the share of a dead comrade.”</p>

<p>It was, as Splice had justly remarked, the two men,
who had claimed the portion of the departed Francis,
under the pretence of being his friends. The other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
person, who was standing by them, was the officer of
the watch, whose duty it was to see the order, which
the captain had given in the morning, carried into
effect. As soon as it was six o’clock, he had proceeded
forwards, and reminded the parties that the time for
the duel had arrived. He found the two men, who
were about to join in deadly fight, drinking with their
comrades, apparently thoughtless of the bloody deed
which they were now bound, by the order of the captain,
to execute. One of them, however, did not seem
as gay as usual, although he made strong efforts to conceal
the thoughtfulness which now and then shewed
itself in his dull and uneasy manner. It might be
imagined that some serious thoughts of parent or child
were forcing themselves on his unwilling memory; or,
perhaps, remorse for some deed that was horrible
even to his piratical conscience was at that moment
haunting him.</p>

<p>When the officer had reminded the two men that the
hour was come, they proceeded with him to the bows of
the schooner.</p>

<p>The officer placed himself by the combatants with the
evident purpose of being a witness, or, rather, the witness,
to the deed.</p>

<p>The two men, who were to fight, proceeded in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
mean time to prepare for the combat. They undid
each his sash, and folded it carefully round his left arm,
examined the edges of their poniards, and placed themselves
in attitude, with the left arm raised, as if supporting
a shield. This was done with the most astonishing
coolness, not a word was spoken between the
antagonists, not a malignant or malicious glance escaped
from either the one or the other, but the features of the
two men that faced each other were locked in that grave
fierceness which is too deep to be expressed by changes
of the countenance.</p>

<p>Having completed their preparations, the intended
combatants stood for a time inactive, each apparently
expecting the assault of the other, and displaying in
their manly attitude the muscular fulness, bold glance,
and resolute eye, which we admire in the statues of the
ancient gladiators that art has bequeathed to our contemplation.
They seemed by no means eager to assail
each other; they evinced not the impetuosity of men
who rush on each other in the out-burst of their rage:
they seemed to be about to do something which they
were, indeed, obliged to perform, but from which their
natures revolted; their blood was too cold for the deed;
the small portion of a dead comrade was too little to
fire their spirits and spur them headlong on each other.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Still they were obliged to fight. When both had stood,
however, in this manner for a long time, the one who
in the morning had first claimed to be Francis’s friend,
suddenly rushed on his antagonist, and raising his
poniard on high made at his opponent.</p>

<p>By a sudden movement of the body the latter avoided
the blow; as quick as thought the other drew himself up
in his former position, and before his antagonist could
regain the equilibrium which he had partly lost by bending
his body to avoid the blow, he aimed a deadly stab,
and the glistening poniard descended in sure destruction
on the left breast of the stooping antagonist; but a
dexterous parry with the muffled arm averted the blow,
and the poniard passed harmlessly through the scarf.
The apathy or indifference which existed at the beginning
had now passed away, and the fight began to warm.
The two fighters plunged with desperation at each
other, but both seemed equally expert in the use of their
weapons. With the agility and the pliability of serpents
they avoided each other’s blows by the rapid movements
of their bodies, while their feet scarcely moved from the
place in which they were at first planted. On—on they
rushed at each other, but in vain: they were well
matched. The fight now became still more animated;
anger, rage, disappointment, could now be read in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
grim faces of the combatants; their nostrils distended
wide with fatigue, the perspiration poured down their
dark faces, and their lips, curling high with rage
and scorn, exhibited their clenched teeth, white
and glistening beneath the shadow of their black
mustachios.</p>

<p>With a dreadful thrust, one at last buried his poniard
deep into the neck of the other.</p>

<p>Exasperated by the cut, the wounded man made a
desperate rush on his antagonist, who bent his body a
little to the side and gave way to the assailant. Borne
away by his own impetus, and already weakened by the
wound, he staggered forwards a little, and fell flat on his
face. The victor waited for a moment for his antagonist
to rise, but the unhappy man had received his death-blow,
and remained prostrate on the deck. The other,
after this, did not seem to take the slightest notice of his
opponent’s fall, but proceeded with coolness to unfold
his sash from around his arm and to wipe his bloody
poniard. The officer on duty immediately went to the
assistance of the fallen man, and summoning two of the
men of his watch, ordered him to be removed from the
deck. The two sailors bent over the wounded man to
lift him, but they were sullenly repelled. He was the
pirate that had claimed the share last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“Leave me,” he sullenly cried, “leave me, I say;
let me die here.” The sailors drew back.</p>

<p>“Come, comrade,” said the officer, “you cannot
expect us to let you remain here—remove him, my
men.”</p>

<p>The sailors endeavoured again to lay hold of the man,
but, with the impulsive strength of death, he brandished
his poniard about him and kept them away.</p>

<p>“Let me die here, and be damned to me!” he exclaimed,
“I was not Francis’s friend, and I have deserved
to be killed this way,” and he churlishly dropped his
head on the deck.</p>

<p>The sailors, who stood around the dying man, were
surprised and shocked by his confession, for no instance
of such base falsehood had ever been known before on
board the Black Schooner. A strict sense of honor was
maintained among the pirates. This was not only
enforced by the stringent laws which existed, but was
cheerfully cultivated by the men themselves, from
motives not only of obedience, but self-preservation,
for they were fully persuaded that the least breach of
honesty among themselves, would be the end of their
individual security, and the dissolution of their society.</p>

<p>Besides, to men of such dispositions, accustomed as
they were to act openly and to hazard their lives boldly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
such acts of calculating meanness were naturally disgusting.</p>

<p>It may be said that the very illegitimate pursuit in
which they were engaged was itself dishonesty, but it
is to be recollected that they considered piracy not
in the shocking light in which better and more delicate
minds justly view it; but they looked upon it more
like adventures, in which men of spirit could engage
with as much honor, as in fighting under the banners of
stranger kings, for the purpose of conquering distant
and unoffending peoples. They viewed, therefore, this
act of meanness, on the part of the fallen man, with
disgust, and the commiseration which was at first so
spontaneously shown as to an unfortunate party in a
duel, was immediately withdrawn when the dying man
disclosed his crime.</p>

<p>The officer who witnessed the combat, upon hearing
the confession, proceeded immediately to Lorenzo and
reported the circumstance. That officer heard him
with much concern: he knew the extreme penalty that
was attached to such an offence, and his heart was
sickened at the thought of an execution. He listened
to the report of the officer until he had finished, and
remained silent for a time, apparently meditating either
intercession or some other means of avoiding the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
punishment which he well knew the crime of the man
would entail. Every hope, however, seemed to give
way in succession, for, after he had remained silent for
some time, he said, shaking his head:</p>

<p>“I wish to Heaven that man had never come on
board the schooner, or that he should have died, at
least, with his own secret. I shall communicate these
things to the captain: but I pity the poor fellow.”</p>

<p>Accordingly he left his cabin, and got access to that
of the captain, when he repeated the report of the
officer on duty. The captain heard him with the same
grave and apparently apathetic coolness which characterised
him, and then repeated, in his deep sonorous
voice, the fatal sentence—“Let the punishment be
executed upon him.”</p>

<p>While Lorenzo was communicating the latter part of
the intelligence, there might have been discovered a
slight falter in his voice, and some embarrassment in
his manner. He seemed to tremble at the consequence
which such a short sentence would produce, while he
himself was under the sad obligation of pronouncing the
words which would bring about the fatal results that he
seemed to dread so much. He, however, had managed
to inform the captain of the poor man’s crime, and he
still hoped that the circumstance of his being already at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the point of death, from the wound which he had received,
would suspend the punishment which he but too
well knew would follow that which, in the Black
Schooner, was accounted the highest guilt.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, therefore, anxiously watched the countenance
of his cold and stern commander, in the hopes of
being able to read in the expression which his report
would produce, something that would lead him to
believe that the unhappy culprit should be spared the
horrors of an execution, when the hand of death seemed
to be already laid so heavily upon him. But the features
of the captain changed not: it is true, the minutest
scrutiny may have detected a transitory alteration in
the eyes, but that was more terrible than assuring. It
lasted but for a moment, the face wore its own cold
severity when the fatal “let the punishment be executed
upon him” was pronounced.</p>

<p>Lorenzo silently rose, bowed, and retired. No man
ever pretended to advise the chief; he seemed one who
held counsel but with himself, he carried his discipline
and his doctrine of expediency so far, that he never permitted
either the suggestions of his officers, nor heard
the prayers of mercy when once his commands were
issued. Lorenzo knew that: more tender than his pursuit
should have made him, he felt deeply for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
wretched man who was doomed, that hour, to die for the
satisfaction of the rigid laws of the schooner.</p>

<p>When Lorenzo left the cabin of the captain, he went
on deck, where he gathered the men about him. These
had continued in their places during the duel and the
scene which ensued, apparently unaffected and unmoved
by what was passing before them. During the most
animated part of the combat, they had become as silent
as if they were dumb, while their eyes were rivetted on
the two who were fighting. But as soon as the duel
was over, they fell again into the strain of mirth and
revelry, which had been for a short time suspended, and
the stabs and passes of the late combatants became the
subjects of an animated conversation and of criticism.</p>

<p>But as soon as the wounded man had made known his
crime, a general indignation seemed to seize the pirates.</p>

<p>They talked low and sullenly, and appeared to expect
every moment something whose anticipation already had
the effect of damping their hilarity.</p>

<p>Lorenzo repeated to them, for the sake of form, that
which they already knew, and then repeated the
sentence of the captain. The pirates spoke not a word,
but a deep silence reigned among them. The officer of
the watch was then requested to cast lots among his
men for two who should execute the sentence. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
two on whom the lot fell, preceded by the officer, shortly
came up to the wounded man. They seemed very
much dissatisfied with the duty that had devolved upon
them.</p>

<p>The officer bent over the wounded man and reminded
him that he had violated the most binding of their laws,
and, at the same time, had exposed the life of a comrade
to his own poniard, when he knew all the while
that he had no right to contend for the portion which
had been bequeathed by one dead comrade to another.
He repeated the usual sentence passed in that case, and
stated that the captain had also ordered its execution,
and told him that within a few moments he should no
longer live.</p>

<p>“Have you,” he asked, in conclusion, “any request to
make?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the wounded man, with the same
sullenness as before.</p>

<p>The two men now raised the culprit on the bulwarks
of the schooner. One of them supported him there,
while the other proceeded to attach to his legs two
cannon-balls, which were strongly tied up in pieces of
old canvass. The culprit watched these preparations
with the most unmoved indifference and most sullen
cynicism. By this time he had lost a great quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
blood, and his face was horribly pale and haggard, and
wore under the shade of his malignant eyes an expression
of deep malice, accompanied with a spiteful feeling
against all men on account of the disappointment he had
met, and the discomfiture which he had experienced in
the fight. He spoke not a word; not a tender feeling
seemed to warm his heart at that moment. The
many years which he had, no doubt, passed among those
from whom he was on the point of being cast away for
ever, seemed not to recall to his gloomy recollection one
single happy, or convivial moment which he might
fondly contemplate; nor did the remembrance of some
distant friend, of mother, or sister, or of wife, appear to
force itself upon the man, whose moments were now
numbered; but stolid, cold, and sullen, he lay on the
bulwarks—on the brink of his existence.</p>

<p>The chest and other effects belonging to him were
now brought and placed also on the rails. To them
were also attached cannon-balls, and they were supported
in that position by one of the men who seemed to await
the orders of the officer.</p>

<p>They had not to wait long: the officer made a sign,
and the wretched man, with his effects, was precipitated
into the deep. A few bubbles arose to the surface, and
the ocean rolled on over the executed pirate. Not an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
eye followed the splash, not a pirate looked where the
waters had settled for ever over their victim, but the
crew seemed to erase, at once, from their recollection
the existence of their late dishonest comrade. They
still sat at their cans, but the elasticity of the
revelry was broken, to those grim men themselves such
a death was solemn: the recent execution damped
their spirits, and their pleasure was no longer like
pleasure. The men and the officer returned to the
duties of their watch. The sun sank in the horizon,
night came, silence resumed its wonted reign, and the
Black Schooner rode in the stillness of the deep over
the long lazy billows of the Caribean Sea.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as the sun had risen the next morning, the
crew was again summoned to the main deck. They
appeared, as on the day before, in their best costume,
and fell into the same order.</p>

<p>The seamen, who belonged to the prize-ship, together
with the master fisherman and his men, were placed by
themselves, while the priest and the young lady were,
as a mark of distinction, accommodated with deck-stools
apart.</p>

<p>As soon as the men had assembled, the captain made
his appearance on deck. He was appareled in the
uniform, which it would appear he always wore when he
was out of his cabin: the deep red cap, with the skull
and cross bones, also covered his head. The expression
of his features, if possible, was that of even more gravity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
than usual, and the melancholy cast which stamped that
gravity was, perhaps, somewhat more deepened. He
seated himself immediately on a chair, which was ready
there for him, and ordered the prisoner who, the day
before, had been dragged away to close confinement, to
be brought forward.</p>

<p>This individual was immediately escorted from the
forward part of the vessel, and placed in the space
reserved within the two lines of pirates, and face to face
with the captain.</p>

<p>The prisoner was a man somewhat above the ordinary
height, of a demeanour which might have once been, to
a great extent, commanding, but which seemed to have
parted with whatever of native dignity it possessed, in
proportion, as the spirit of excellence and elegance,
which usually imparts character to the exterior, gave
place to thoughts either of sordid pursuits, or to mean
and selfish cares. He was now slightly bent, more,
perhaps, from carelessness to his gait than with age:
for his years could not have been very many. His
hair, that still grew thick and bushy, was only just
beginning to show a silvery tinge. His features were
marked and manly, and must have been, at one time,
very handsome, though now they were stamped with a
disagreeable appearance of coldness and selfishness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
which was calculated to arouse, at once, in a stranger’s
mind, a strong prejudice against the individual; while
his sharp, twinkling, cozening eyes, in particular, that
shone from under a veil of shaggy eyebrows, that flew
from object to object, that rested on no man for a
moment, nor dared meet the glances that they encountered,
conveyed immediately an idea of the lack of that
firm, unequivocating honor which is essentially necessary
in the constitution of a proper character.</p>

<p>When the prisoner was placed before him, the captain
fixed upon him a deep, penetrating, and earnest look,
that made him cower, and then slowly and solemnly
pronounced these words:—</p>

<p>“James Willmington, before God, and in the presence
of these men, and in the name of Nature, I accuse
you of having violated one of the most sacred and most
binding of her laws; of having abandoned your offspring;
of having neglected the being whose existence
sprang from yours, and for whom you were bound by a
holy obligation to care and provide.”</p>

<p>The captain paused for a moment, and still kept his
penetrating and unaltering eye fixed on the prisoner.
The latter, on hearing this charge, raised his eyes in
affrighted surprise, but quickly looked down as he met
those of the pirate captain, while his color came and went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“You shall be witness against yourself: because,
although I lately took proper measures to make myself
certain, that you were the individual who was indicated
as the person that was my father; still, not having ever
known you, and not possessing any tender instincts to
guide me with regard to you, I should have always felt
some slight doubt about your identity, if your fear, and
miscalculating cunning had not, the day before yesterday,
unwarily betrayed you into an avowal which, I must
admit, I was not ready to hear from your lips. These
men shall be your judges. You will be permitted full
liberty to express yourself, at the proper time, as freely
as you may think proper, omitting nothing that you
may believe to be conducive to your safety. I shall
reserve to myself the part of passing sentence upon you
and of directing its execution; and I promise you, that
whatever defence you may be able to make shall weigh
as heavily as lead in your favour: for I should be loath
to punish you if even you can contrive to justify yourself.”</p>

<p>“But what is the meaning—?” the prisoner began to
inquire.</p>

<p>The captain pressed his finger firmly on his lips, and
Willmington was daunted into silence. The pirate
captain then went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“I need not now call it to your recollection,” he said,
“that I am your son. Your memory, which all along
was so unfaithful on that point, seems to have suddenly
improved, when you saw me in the cabin of the ship
which I had taken, and then you remembered well that
I was your son. By your own confession, therefore, I
am saved the trouble of proving for my satisfaction
the natural connexion which exists between us. It is,
therefore, undoubted and settled, that I stand towards
you in the relation of son to father, or, in other words,
speaking more scientifically, I am your immediate progeny.
This is clear. Now, by certain feelings which
are implanted in us, and which are considered the
laws of the Creator, written on the heart of man at his
creation, we are admonished that the care of those
who spring immediately from us, is one of our principle
duties. But, as we are so apt to mistake habits for
innate feelings, perhaps it will be better and safer, not
to proceed on this one, however strong or indisputable
it may appear. Let feeling, therefore, or instinct,
be entirely eliminated, and let us appeal to Nature
herself in her manifestations—to Nature that never
errs. You admit that I am your son—your offspring;
you owed me as such offspring, at least, protection
until I was strong enough to provide for myself and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
to avoid injuries. Contrast now your conduct with
your duty. You are aware, that from the hour of
the birth of this, your son, up to this, you have never
taken the trouble even to inquire what had become of
the being of whose existence you were the secondary
cause; whether the mother, of whom he was born, had
survived to nurture him; whether he was exposed, in
the helplessness of infancy, to the privations which overwhelm
even maturer age; or, worse still than all, whether
he had fallen into stranger’s hands, to be the humble
object of capricious charity. You did not trouble yourself
to learn whether the cold winds froze him in the
very beginning of life; whether he was a prey to the
beasts of the woods, or whether the vultures of the air
had pecked or torn him, or had fed upon him; he was
forsaken, and left unprotected by the person who had
given him life—life, which with kindness is made
happiness itself, but which by unkindness is rendered
worse than the bitterest misery. The tiger will tear
to pieces the bold intruder that menaces, nay, that approaches
its cubs, and, fiercely fighting, will die for the
protection of its young. The solitary bird of the desert
will open its vein, and make its parched young ones
drink of its life blood, then die; the venomous serpent
will writhe and twist under the fiercest foe for its hatchling;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
but you, unlike the tiger, the bird, or the serpent,
not resembling even the most ferocious brute, or the
lowest reptile that crawls upon this earth, you cast
away from you, and shut out from your mind and heart,
until a cowardly consideration for your own safety made
remember it, the blood of your blood, and the flesh of
your flesh, which even the common affection that you
have for yourself—your very essential selfishness itself—should
have made you love and cherish; or, at least,
feed and water. I am your son; I charge you with
having abandoned me from childhood; what defence
can you make? I give you ten minutes to reflect and
to answer.”</p>

<p>The pirate captain then ceased: his eyes were fixed
on the deck, his arms were crossed over his breast, and
his features were locked in cold but firmest determination,
and he had the air of one, who was resolved to go
through a prescribed form with patience and precision.
The men embraced the opportunity afforded by this
pause to interchange looks one with the other. Their
usual ferocious character of mein was heightened for
the history which their chief had just partly related, no
doubt recalled to the greater part of those men who
stood that morning on the deck of the Black Schooner,
the injustice, whether real or merely supposed, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
which they had been treated by others. Victims to
wrongs and injuries which others had heaped upon
them, they had permitted their feelings to become cankered.
Accustomed for the most part to the circumstances
of an easy, and as far as some of them were
concerned, an estated position, they could not in the
hour of adversity, bend to the petty pursuits of life,
while their pride, at the same time, would not let them
lead a different sort of existence among those who were
either their companions or their inferiors in their better
days.</p>

<p>Turning their backs on pretended friends and unkind
kindred, they had fled to the protection of the sea,
where they could enjoy the doubtful comfort of their
misanthropy to the full, and feed at pleasure on their
own griefs; while their sword was ready to be used as
well for pleasure as for booty, against the whole world
to which they at the same time boldly and fearlessly
gave defiance. The recollection of other days, however,
fell upon their spirits, and how scared soever their sensibilities
might be by a thousand scenes of blood, how
hardened soever by long familiarity with misery, still
those impressions to which in the day-dreams of their
youth they had fondly bound their happiness, could not
but be awakened by the tale that seemed to hold up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
each of themselves the fleeting reflection of their own
hopeful, but long since spoilt and blighted existence.</p>

<p>It was resentment, so strong as to have primarily germinated
disgust in their hearts, and next a distaste for
the society of their species, that had made them separate
themselves from mankind and wander misanthropically
about, until they eventually found themselves combined
with others as unfortunate, as unenduring, and as proud
as themselves; it was resentment of injustices of a
similar nature to the instance to which their chief was a
victim, that had changed their lot, and hating still the
causes of their unhappiness, they were eager to wreak
vengeance upon any individual to whom they could
bring home any such offence. They interchanged
fierce looks with each other, cast now and then dark
and boding glances on the prisoner, and portentously
stroked their dark and flowing beards. As for the
prisoner himself, he appeared confounded; still there
was not that vacant appearance of embarrassed simplicity
about him which we generally observe in those
that are innocent when unhappy circumstances put them
at a loss. His was a distressing confusion—the confusion
that conscious guilt, too clear to admit of even the
shifts of equivocation and falsity had produced—a confusion
that was doubled by the mortifying, degrading,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
and overwhelming fact, that his accuser, the witness, and
the sufferer from his offence was his own son. The guilty
father therefore stood dumb before the son—the judge.</p>

<p>The ten minutes had now elapsed, the captain raised
his head, and said,</p>

<p>“Do you then say nothing in your defence?”</p>

<p>“I—I—I do not understand what all this means,” at
last Willmington falteringly said.</p>

<p>“So much the worse” dryly observed the captain.</p>

<p>“You charge me with an offence,” continued Willmington,
“which you make worse than it is; you must
remember men are not punished in society for such
offences, and I do not see why I should be ill-treated on
its account, when others are not.”</p>

<p>An indistinct smile played about the lips of the captain,
as he answered,</p>

<p>“That is no defence.”</p>

<p>“Beside,” Willmington went on to say, “what right
have you to constitute yourself my judge?”</p>

<p>“The right,” answered the captain, “of an injured
man, who avenges the wrong done to himself, and also
to one who was his nearest and dearest blood, and
whose memory demands justice.”</p>

<p>“But, by the laws, a man cannot redress his own
wrongs,” said Willmington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“By what laws?” inquired the captain.</p>

<p>“By the laws of the land,” answered Willmington.</p>

<p>A sneer was to be traced on the rude lineaments of
every pirate’s face, when this answer was given.</p>

<p>“Look up there, man,” said the captain, as he pointed
to the black flag that was floating gracefully from the
half lowered gaff, “while that flies there, there is no law
on board this schooner save mine and great Nature’s.
Look around you, on the right and on the left, you see
those who know no other laws but these two, and who
are ready to enforce them. Look still farther around,
you see but a waste of water, with no tribunals at hand,
in which complaints may be heard, or by which grievances
may be redressed. Place no hope, therefore, on
‘the laws of the land.’ Have you any thing more pertinent
to urge?”</p>

<p>“I have to request,” replied Willmington, still more
embarrassed, “to be landed with your other captives,
that is all.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” coolly observed the captain; then
turning to his men, he said, “my men, you have heard
my accusation against this man. He seems unable to
defend and justify himself. It is my intention to punish
him by making him suffer that which I have had myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
to undergo. Be you witnesses that I have given him a
fair and open trial.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, bravo!” ran in deep, but subdued tones
along the ranks of the pirates.</p>

<p>“Listen to your sentence, James Willmington,” continued
the captain, “you are guilty, in my opinion, of
the greatest crime which an individual, as a man and a
father, can commit. You have prostituted the law of
nature to your own selfish gratification, perjured yourself,
and given that life for which you neglected to provide
and care. I have afforded you an opportunity of
showing yourself innocent—if you could—of this grave
charge. You have not been able to do so. The
punishment I design you is this: you will be cast adrift
on the ocean; you will have an empty cask to rest
upon; you refused me bread—I refuse you shelter on
board of my schooner; you are guilty of what we all on
board this vessel abhor; you are, therefore, no proper
companion for us, and you must be thrust forth from
among us. I shall, however, take care that you should
survive as long as possible, that you may be the more
able to realize the pangs of that famine which I endured
by your heartlessness. In two hour’s time the sentence
shall be executed. Prepare to meet your Creator.
Lead him hence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Good God,” now cried the prisoner, his eyes seeming
to be about to fall from their sockets with fear, as
the full extent and reality of his danger, now clearly
struck him, “good God, surely you do not mean to
murder me: have mercy on me, I beseech you.”</p>

<p>The captain did not raise his eyes from a paper which
he had taken from the breast of his uniform, and which
he was then reading. “But,” continued the prisoner,
as the pirates prepared to drag him away, “remember,
I am your father, you owe me honour and respect—how
dare you, raise your hand against your parent?”</p>

<p>The captain at these words suddenly raised his head,
and cast an angry and steadfast look on the prisoner,
and after the lapse of a few seconds, during which he
kept his eyes still rivetted on him, he said, with biting
scorn—</p>

<p>“Remember that you are my father! you ought to
ask me to forget it. It is because I remember you are
my father that I shall now prepare for you your just
measure of suffering. It is very probable you never
expected to be called one day to account by the son who
was the fruit of a delightful indulgence, but which was
to be considered no longer than during the short space
which it afforded you pleasure. Very little do you, and
such as you think, when in the turpitude of your perjured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
souls, you delude the confiding and helpless things who
sin from too great a confidence in your protestations of
honor, or rather, are too innocent to detect your falsehoods,
that the beings to whom you may give life are
things who like yourselves may possess feelings, and
who may one day seek to avenge the treachery practised
on their mothers. Selfish man! your selfishness pursues
you at the very moment when your existence is in all
probability about to end. You crouched to me, and
sought to propitiate me by a show of paternal sensibility,
when you saw me enter with my friends the cabin
where you stood writhing in your terror, and to-day you
again remind me that I am your son. Now your paternal
feelings are very strong, and your memory remarkably
faithful when you expect to save your life by remembering
me. But you, of course, recollected nothing
of me, nor were you so feelingly sentimental when I
once wrote to you for the mite, which you would never
have missed from your treasures. Your selfish artifice
shall avail you nothing here. In two hours, as I have
said, you will be cast adrift on the ocean. Men, lead
him away.”</p>

<p>Willmington was taken away and confined to the
part of the schooner in which he had been kept since his
arrival on board. The crew remained in profound
silence, in the same order, and the captain was silently
studying the paper which he had in his hand, and from
the perusal of which he had a little before raised his
head to address the prisoner.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few moments, he handed it to
Lorenzo, and requested him to have a machine made
according to the plan set forth in it.</p>

<p>The chief officer bowed, and took it to the officer of
the watch. The captain then slowly rose, cast a look
around him on the ocean and at the prize-ship, then
descended the cabin steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>The men dispersed, and, in a short time, the deck
remained in the occupation of those only whose duty it
was to keep watch at that time.</p>

<p>At the bows of the schooner a carpenter was now to
be seen busy at work. He was labouring in the greatest
haste. Before him was a plan, and a young officer, the
one in command, might be observed now and then to
leave the sacred boards of the after-deck, and walk
forward to inspect the thing that the man was constructing.</p>

<p>Two hours had now elapsed since the captain had
passed sentence on the prisoner, and the time had now
arrived to execute it.</p>

<p>The moments that completed the two hours had
scarcely fled, before Lorenzo came on deck. He proceeded
immediately to inspect the machine which he had
ordered to be made, in obedience to the commands he
had received.</p>

<p>The captain himself, a short time afterwards, made
his appearance. The machine was ordered to be brought
to the gangway, where he carefully examined it. It
was made of an empty cask, to which something like
the keel of a ship was attached. This appendage was
covered with heavy sheets of lead, for the apparent
purpose of being made to keep downwards, and so to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
prevent the machine from rolling over. The upper
part was provided with a wooden seat, made in the
shape of a Spanish saddle, the bows of which rose
very high, and were crowned with a piece of flat board,
which seemed intended to answer the purpose of a
shelf.</p>

<p>When the captain had examined this machine, he
ordered that a few biscuits should be secured on the
shelf above mentioned, and, at the same time, commanded
the prisoner to be led forth.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the deck had become again
crowded, for every one knew what would take place at
the end of the two hours, which had just expired. But
the pirates were not now drawn up in the same order as
before. They crowded in the foremost part of the
vessel, some lounged on the bulwarks, others bent over
the riggings, watching, in moody calmness, what was
going on. No one dared assist in the preparations
except those who formed the watch of the hour. The
captive priest, also, with his beautiful ward, stood leaning
on the taffrail of the schooner, isolated, as it were,
amidst the many that were on board the vessel.</p>

<p>The prisoner was brought forward to the gangway.
He was haggard and worn: the feelings of the two hours
which intervened between him and that doom, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
was worse than death, concentrated as they were into
the intensest agony, preyed like gnawing worms upon
his body.</p>

<p>“Hear my last prayer, for mercy’s sake!” he cried,
with passion, to the captain, as he threw himself at his
feet, “oh! spare me this dreadful death; give me but
life, and I shall give you all I have.—Can you treat
your father in this manner? Oh, my son—my good
son—my beloved son! I shall give you all my property—if—”</p>

<p>“Bind his arms,” said the captain.</p>

<p>The arms of the prisoner were immediately seized;
he resisted madly and violently, and, in the strength of
desperation, he shook off the first pirate that attempted
to lay hands on him. But he was quickly mastered, and
his arms were tightly tied with small cord behind his
back. The machine was now supported perpendicularly,
and it resembled, as it stood in that position, a horse
ready saddled.</p>

<p>The prisoner became still more agitated and terror-stricken
when his arms were bound, and his cries were
more piteous and heart-rending.</p>

<p>“Oh! ask mercy for me, my men,” he cried, imploringly,
to the pirates around him, whose coolness seemed
to mock his wretchedness, “I shall make you all rich;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
do not—do not throw me into the sea. Holy father,
holy father,” looking towards the priest, “you may
succeed, you may move him, you may curse him; ask
mercy for me—do not let me be drowned.”</p>

<p>“Put him on,” the captain said.</p>

<p>The wretched man was lifted bodily, and laid astride
upon the cask.</p>

<p>“Curses on you! do not—do not, for your soul’s sake,
murder me,” he cried, and struggled like those who
alone can struggle who see death before them.</p>

<p>But it was of no avail. The pirates seized his legs,
and tied them tightly underneath the cask, so that the
miserable prisoner had not the power of making any
other movements except that of inclining his body a
little backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>“Fix the tackles.” The tackles were adjusted.</p>

<p>“Fiends! hell hounds,” he yelled out, as the first
strain of the ropes was felt on the cask, and laid hold of
the pirate that was next to him with his teeth—another
strain, and he held between his teeth a shred of the
man’s woollen shirt.</p>

<p>The cask was hoisted up, to be let down overboard.
The cries of the fated Willmington increased still more—he
roared franticly. The cask with the prisoner balanced
between the masts of the schooner for a moment, in cruel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
suspense, while not a sound was to be heard, except his
hoarse, pitiful, and moving cries.</p>

<p>The pirates looked on with sullen calmness; the captain
was the same imperturbable man. But the priest
could not withstand this moving scene; he threw himself
at the captain’s feet, and earnestly begged him to show
mercy:—“mercy,” he added, “that was the most
acceptable offering to heaven.”</p>

<p>“Good priest,” answered the captain, “if you can
soothe the end of that wretched being, do so. But
pray not to me, I never change.”</p>

<p>Slowly—slowly—slowly—the cask, with its living
rider, who was shrieking like the damned, was lowered:
it reached the water: the tackles were unfastened, and
away, away, it slowly floated on the long high waves
that bore it rapidly from the schooner.</p>

<p>The roars and cries of the prisoner rang over the
silent sea. Every eye was rivetted in awful intentness
on the cask and its burthen. The captain alone was
turned away from the direction where his father lay
pinioned on a cask at the mercy of the winds and waves.
He cast but one glance on the cask as it was lowered
into the sea, and never looked at it again.</p>

<p>Indifference—indifference, as cold and as icy as death,
indifference, such as nature can admit but only when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
every fibre of feeling is burnt into hard callousness by
the searing iron of some deep unpardonable offence,
had wrapped its clammy folds around his heart.</p>

<p>Reader, have you ever felt the absorbing love that
sank and merged your existence into that of a cherished
object, and have you ever felt the gall of sneering ridicule
from her? If you have, then you know the feeling
that possessed the pirate captain. Have you ever demanded
bread from a parent whom you may have loved
to excess and received a stone, or have you ever asked
water from the author of your existence and received
poison? Then you can fancy the captain’s sentiments,
or have you ever, while straining your industry and
energy to the utmost, been ground down to misery and
despair by him from whom nature taught you to expect
love and protection, while he himself was rioting in profuse
abundance? if you have, and we trust heaven has
always preserved you from such a bitter experience,
you can then realize the feeling which existed in the
bosom of the pirate captain.</p>

<p>“Make sail,” the captain said to the officer of the
watch, after he had cast a glance on the horizon.</p>

<p>The schooner which, during all this time, was lying
to the wind under only a half of her mainsail and jib,
was immediately put under the press of all her sails.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
She had shot a-head for some yards, when the captain
gave orders to change the course.</p>

<p>“Ready about.”</p>

<p>“Ready about,” was echoed forwards in the firm
disciplined tones of the sailors.</p>

<p>“Hard a-lee.”</p>

<p>“Hard a-lee,” the man at the helm answered.</p>

<p>The helm was put down, and the long snake-like
schooner bore up gracefully to the wind, the sails
fluttered for a moment, and she leaned smoothly on the
other tack.</p>

<p>Like a dolphin she cut through the water; the spray
played about her bows, and the waves barely touched
her sides as she glided through them.</p>

<p>A signal had been made to the prize-ship, and she,
too, was put under full sail.</p>

<p>Away—away—the schooner went, and left far, far
behind, the wretched being who had been thrown overboard.
He could scarcely now be seen, it was but when
the cask rose and fell on the crest of the heaving
billows that a glimpse could be had of him. But his
cries still reached the flying schooner. They gradually
grew fainter and fainter; then they came like the
intermittent moans of agony, low, and few, and far
between, and then they were heard no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>The captain gave his orders to the officer on duty
to steer a certain course and then left the deck.</p>

<p>The day had by this time passed, and the fleeting
twilight of the tropics was yielding to the darkness of
night. The crew of the schooner betook themselves to
their respective quarters. But the priest and his ward
still lingered on the deck. Their strained eyes were
fixed in the direction where the cask and its load had
disappeared, and fancied they saw, every moment, the
unfortunate Willmington rise, now and then, in the dim
crepuscule. But they watched in vain, and saw not
what they imagined they did. Far, far out of sight was
the cask already borne, and Heaven only knew whether
the living being, that rode upon it, still drew the breath
of life.</p>

<p>Saddened by the event of the day, they at length, in
melancholy silence, left the deck, when the darkness had
increased and had deprived them of the power of
continuing their useless watch. Night, then, closed over
the Black Schooner; and the faint ripplings of the
water as she glided through, were the only sounds that
might fall on the listening ear.</p>

<p>Silence reigned over the schooner. The pirates had
retired to their hammocks, and all, except the men of
the watch, were wrapped in sleep.</p>

<p>In his cabin, in the centre of the vessel, Lorenzo sat
alone and pensive. The hour when he ought to have
betaken himself to his berth had already long passed,
but he still sat in his chair at the head of the table that
stood in the middle of his cabin. He was still dressed
in his uniform, nor were his arms even removed from
the sash that bore them.</p>

<p>He sat gazing silently on the lamp which burnt suspended
from the deck. One would have imagined he
was in deep contemplation of that vessel, if the vagueness
observable in the fixed gaze of his eye, did not too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
plainly tell that the subject of his thoughts, the object
of his contemplation was not the thing which was at
that moment before him, but some other which was in
his mind.</p>

<p>The flying hours passed: Lorenzo was still sitting in
his chair in the same absorbed contemplation. Now a
placid smile would play over his features, now they
would be locked in the fiercest sternness. There seemed
to be in him at that moment a conflict of emotions deep
and violent.</p>

<p>At last, as if he had taken a final resolution, “I shall
do it!” he exclaimed. He then drew from a desk
materials for writing and penned a letter.</p>

<p>When this was done, he took off his boots, put on his
slippers, and enveloped himself in his thick boat cloak.</p>

<p>He then cautiously opened the door of his cabin, in
which the light was carefully extinguished, and went
out.</p>

<p>He proceeded down the long passage which led to the
captain’s quarters, and in which opened a door that led
to the cabins occupied by the priest and his beautiful
ward.</p>

<p>Stealthily and quietly Lorenzo moved down the passage;
a lamp faintly burnt at some distance from the
entrance to the captain’s cabin, and by its dim light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
might be seen the dark outlines of the men who, at
intermediate distances, guarded the corridor.</p>

<p>Lorenzo could not but feel some alarm when his eyes
fell upon those tall forms, for he was conscious that he
was treading on forbidden ground, where, to be found
without the ring—the usual passport—was instant
death. Such was the rigour of the discipline in which
alone suspicion could hope to find security.</p>

<p>It is true he was not within the circle of the captain’s
quarters, but, nevertheless, his being discovered in the
passage at that time of night, and in such guise,
would lead to consequences equally as fatal, as if he had
trespassed on interdicted ground.</p>

<p>His careful concealment of his person, and the change
of his boots, would have worn such an aspect of conspiracy
in the eyes of his superior, that nothing could have
been strong enough to blot out the distrust which the
latter would ever afterwards entertain of him, if even
the consideration of his services and old friendship should
have proved strong enough to induce the captain to
spare his life.</p>

<p>The thoughts rushed in an instant on the officer as he
stood for a moment looking at the erect and steady sentinel
at the end of the passage before him.</p>

<p>They fell on him with all the weight and dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
truthfulness which they possessed. He remained for
a moment irresolute, but at length the daring spirit
which his mode of life had fostered, and that indescribable
feeling people call love, but which is as incomprehensible
as it is omnipotent in its influence, nerved him
against the danger which he apprehended, and he took
two or three steps forwards with the same caution with
which he had come into the passage. But he had gone
only a few steps when he saw that the attention of the
sentinel was drawn in his direction. The latter had
changed his straightforward look and was seemingly
endeavouring to discover some object which had
attracted his notice up the passage.</p>

<p>Lorenzo stood—his worst fears he thought were about
to be realized. He saw at once the certainty of his
being detected, and the consequences of that pressed on
his mind.</p>

<p>The thought, too, which always afflicts ingenuous
minds, when they are conscious that they are not culpable
of an offence from which they instinctively recoil
with horror, but with which circumstances conspire to
charge them, fell heavily and miserably upon him.</p>

<p>The most desperately situated always hope—there is
a hope almost in despondency itself; Lorenzo still hoped,
in spite of the peril before him, that he would escape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
discovery. He knew that he could not be seen by the
sentinel in the darkness of the passage, and expected
that the latter would turn away, when he found that
nothing was to be seen. Lorenzo, therefore, remained
quietly where he was. The sentinel continued to gaze
earnestly up the passage, and at last came out of his
niche, and began to walk straightway towards Lorenzo.</p>

<p>“I am lost,” the officer said to himself, and at once
made up his mind to stay where he was and surrender
to the sentinel. The man came towards him, but there
was such indecision in his walk, that the officer could
not fail to perceive, at once, that the man on duty was
only taking a walk to see if there really was any one in
the passage, without being actually certain of his
presence.</p>

<p>“There may be a chance of escape, yet,” he said to
himself, and drew himself closely up against the side of
the passage.</p>

<p>As the sentinel approached, his anxiety increased.
The sentinel drew nearer and nearer: the officer drew
himself up closely—and more closely; the sentinel was
now but a few steps from him, he pressed still more
closely on the side. Gently it yielded, and Lorenzo
caught himself as he was just falling in the inside of a
cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>With wonderful presence of mind, he closed the little
door that had admitted him, and heard the heavy footsteps
of the sentinel as he passed it on the outside.</p>

<p>With breathless anxiety he listened to the steps; he
heard them diminish until the sentinel had arrived at the
extreme end of the passage, and heard them grow more
and more distinct as he returned at the same leisurely
pace.</p>

<p>Again and again the man on duty passed his door; it
was, therefore, clear that he had not been discovered;
but, as his anxiety about the man outside diminished,
new fears arose with regard to the place in which he
found himself. How was it that the door of that
cabin had been left open, when such regularity usually
existed on board the schooner? Was there any one at
the time in the cabin? if so, the same danger that
threatened him outside would meet him within: for
self-preservation had taught every officer, and every
sailor of the Black Schooner, that their safety could consist
only in the strict observance of its laws in their own
persons, and the rigorous enforcement of them in others.
Every one seemed to know, instinctively, that the chain
which was so variously formed, could be preserved only
by a careful protection of each particular link.
Lorenzo knew if any one was in the cabin, and if he were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
there seen under such circumstances, the person would
make it a point of duty to report it to the chief. His
alarm, therefore, which had partly subsided, grew again
upon him. He remained in the deepest silence and
attention, listening to the steps of the sentinel outside,
who was still patroling the passage from his niche to its
extreme end.</p>

<p>He endeavoured, also, to listen for the breathing of
any one that might be in the cabin, for he wisely concluded,
that if any person was there, he must assuredly
be asleep, or else he should have heard him when he
accidentally tumbled in. But he heard nothing.</p>

<p>His anxiety, however, was not satisfied. He crept
softly by the bed, and listened again, but still he could
hear nothing; he passed his hand over the narrow berth,
but there was no one there.</p>

<p>“Ah! I see,” the officer said to himself, “it is the
cabin of José.”</p>

<p>It was the cabin of the officer who was then on duty,
and Lorenzo breathed more freely; but his anxiety was
soothed down for a moment only, for he immediately
recollected that the night was already much spent, and
that the watch on deck would shortly be relieved; his
difficulty was thus in no manner removed. He reflected
for some time, and concluded, in a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
despair, that fate was determined to ruin him, and he
calmly yielded himself up to the unfortunate destiny
which seemed to pursue him that luckless night.</p>

<p>He calculated that within half an hour’s time the
watch of José would have expired, and that he should
surely be discovered when that officer came down
to his cabin. There might be a chance—though a
desperate one—of escaping the certain detection of
the sentinel outside, although suspicion would inevitably
be raised: but that was the less of the two evils that
beset him. He resolved, accordingly, to wait until the
watch on deck should be near expiration, and then to
make a desperate effort to escape from his dangerous
position.</p>

<p>He remained, then, standing by the door, on the outside
of which the measured footsteps of the guard were
still heard. The time passed away, and the sentinel still
walked the passage. The watch was nearly expired
and he was there still.</p>

<p>“All is lost,” Lorenzo said to himself, and then he
drew up his cloak around him in that resolute manner
that indicates the determination which, from its extremeness,
becomes the kindred of despair; as he drew his
cloak around him, something fell from it: it was the
letter which he had written. He felt about for it in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
dark until it was found. It seemed to revive the feelings
which had begun to slumber under the absorbing solicitude
for his own safety.</p>

<p>“Shall I have put myself in danger and still not
succeed in sending this?” thought he, “what advantage
do we derive from all our acquirements, our high
and glorious reputations, our friendships, our exposures,
and our perils?”—he hastily reasoned—“if we are
driven by the necessity of preserving these to sacrifice
the happiness which we fondly hope to realize from
them? away vain and timid thoughts—I will hazard
everything; but, happen what may, I shall send this.”</p>

<p>Having come to this resolution, Lorenzo waited until
the sentinel had arrived at the head of the passage, and
had, on his return to his niche, passed the door of the
cabin in which he was concealed: he then opened it
softly, and stepped into the passage: and, gathering
himself up closely under its side, began to retire
with as much caution as he had come in. He kept
his eyes all the while fixed on the sentinel or his
shadow, so that he might easily anticipate his movements,
in case he was discovered.</p>

<p>He had reached the top of the large passage, and was
about to take the one which led to his own apartments,
when the footsteps ceased, and the man drew himself up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
as before in his niche. It was evident that whatever
suspicions he may have entertained at first had now
entirely vanished, and that the greater part of the continued
walk which he took, was intended more for his
own recreation than for the interception of any one who
he might have suspected was trespassing on the circle
of his guard, for he seemed to be entirely given up to
his own reflections. Lorenzo stopped when he saw
this; he mused for a moment, but his resolution was
not long in being taken. He bent himself on his knees
and hands, and crept down the passage again; he
stopped several times to study the movements of the
sentinel, all which times he seemed to be the more
assured of his safety; he crept in this manner until he
reached a certain door, and was now but a few yards
from the man on duty. The latter seemed still absorbed
in his own thoughts; Lorenzo drew the letter from his
breast, and pushed it under the door. As he supported
himself on one hand, in doing so, the vessel lurched, and
the hand holding the letter struck against the door.
The sentinel raised his head for a moment, but, concluding
that it was the inmate of the cabin who had
struck by accident against the partition, he relapsed into
his meditative state.</p>

<p>Lorenzo drew himself carefully back in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
manner as he had gone forwards. When he got to the
head of the passage, he jumped on his feet and hastened
to his own cabin.</p>

<p>He had scarcely shut the door, when he heard the
heavy footsteps of the officer, who had now been relieved,
on the companion stairs as he descended to his cabin.</p>

<p>On the next morning when Agnes—by that name
the priest called her—the fair captive, was going
towards the door of the cabin which was given up to
her use, she beheld a sealed letter at her feet. After
her first surprise had somewhat lessened, she remained
standing for a time in deep reflection over it, endeavouring
to conjecture whose it might be, to whom
addressed, and what could be its purport. At last,
being unable to restrain her impulse of curiosity, she
took it up and saw that it was for her. But the superscription
was in the handwriting of a man—and not
that of her guardian.</p>

<p>What mystery could that indicate? What could it
portend?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>Before opening the letter, the beautiful young lady
remained for a long time gazing on it, while at the same
time she was led away into a train of strange and complicated
thoughts. Could that letter be, she inquired
of herself, the forerunner of some attempt that the
pirate captain contemplated against her safety and
honor? She trembled at the thought: she recollected
that among the outrages and ravaging descents of the
Boucaneers, their cold-blooded cruelties upon the sex
were not the least of their horrible deeds; and should
this captain now design to add her to the multitude of
those of her condition, who had been sacrificed to the
profligacy of similarly lawless men?... It is true, up to
that time, she had been treated with an amount of respect
and kindness that could not be exceeded even by the
fastidious solicitude of the most polite, or by the benevolence
of the most virtuous; and this captain seemed to
be somewhat different from the heartless freebooters of
whom she had heard: but might he not carry under
that stern, and apparently callous exterior, designs which
would be the more to be feared as they should be the
more premeditated. If so, what chance had she of
resisting him? Words would not prevail with him;
entreaties could have no effect on him; for she had seen
him send his own father adrift on a cask on the wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
ocean, and every thing, and every one on board of that
schooner seemed to give way to him and sink under his
will: what could move him,—what protect her?</p>

<p>A blush suffused her beautiful face. She was inclined
to fancy that there might be one on board who would
protect her. But yet they were both pirates, and why
should she expect that they should incur one another’s
displeasure and enmity for her sake—an unfortunate
captive. But although Agnes feared, still there was
hope in her. Something told her, perhaps her own
heart, that mysterious and unerring index of the truth,
that he who had been so attentive to her from the
moment when she set foot on board the schooner—that
Lorenzo would defend her.</p>

<p>There is a mystery of mind, a language of thought,
and a sympathy of soul, for which the greatest philosophers
are still unable to account. There is that which
conveys from the loving to the loved a mute and silent
intelligence: there is that in us which converses without
being heard, which communicates without being seen,
and even while the tongue is tied and the eye is closed,
tells to those we love of the sentiment that we foster and
cherish in our breast. The mind of the young lady
told her that Lorenzo would protect her innocence and
honor, and she was somewhat calmed by this assurance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
however slight and ungrounded, a more sceptical
thinker would no doubt have considered it. Escaping
in this manner from these unpleasant and dark thoughts
that alarmed her, she was immediately recalled to herself,
and proceeded to open the letter. She hastily and
eagerly glanced over it, raised her head for a time, and
then read, and read, and read again.</p>

<p>The letter was this:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lady, though I am a pirate, recoil not from me. I
am sensible to the feelings of honor, and need not be
feared by any lady; in the uprightness of my soul I have
dared to love you; deign to cast but one look on me, and
let me believe I may hope.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lorenzo.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Agnes read this over and over again in nervous trepidation,
then folded it, and put it by.</p>

<p>She was a victim to strong contending emotions.
She felt she knew not what for Lorenzo, but he was a
pirate. She could not imagine that she loved: no, she
did not; but she was grateful to the man as she had
always seen him, gentle and kind, and apparently
unstained by any crime: but she recoiled from the <i>pirate</i>.
It would appear that even her gratitude could not succeed
in mantling the hideousness of that name. Yet he
was always so respectful to her! Could a pirate at
heart be so? And if he were a pirate, such as she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
heard those men were, could he write to her in that
manner? No, it could not be. And joy glistened in
her face as she seemed to congratulate herself on having
come to a conclusion that was so favourable to Lorenzo.</p>

<p>Upon this she seemed to fall into an agreeable reverie:
pleasure seemed to play on her face, as she thought she
had successfully washed away the stain from the man on
which her sentiments had already been anchored. Distressing
thoughts, however, will force themselves on
the happiest moments of our existence. At the height
of her self-gratulation, the idea of the pirate again
occurred.</p>

<p>“But who is he?” she inquiringly muttered, “what
is he—a—? Oh! no, I cannot, I will not, I must not
think of him,” and she burst into a flood of tears. She
wept and wept: now roused herself to extraordinary
firmness, and resolutely dried her tears, but it was to
let them flow in larger and fuller currents a moment
after.</p>

<p>She was weeping over the ruined hopes of her own
feelings:—of her first love.</p>

<p>Agnes had been born and brought up in the seclusion
which necessarily surrounds a residence in the West
Indies. She had seen but few persons besides the
neighbours that had their plantations in the vicinity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
her father’s estate. She had never met any one on
whom she could pour out the love that a tropical nature
had lavished upon her. Her feelings at the moment
when she got into the position which led to her meeting
with Lorenzo were strong and fresh, and were in that
state in which the mysterious law of human sociality
required, that they should find an object on which they
could alight and rest. They had alighted on Lorenzo—not
by reasoning—not by calculation. They had alighted
on Lorenzo, because they had alighted on him. Her
feelings had flown and rested upon him, either independently
of her volition, or so closely united with it, that
it was not possible to say whether she loved, because
she chose to love, or whether she loved because she
found herself loving.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of her love: but if nature had
implanted in her, feelings that were so strong, pure, and
good, education had taught her that to control them was
also necessary. She reflected that, above all instances,
that was the one in which she required all the power
that she might possess to restrain herself; for common
prudence itself, unassisted by the imparted precepts of
propriety, was sufficient to make her careful how she
fostered the feelings, which had already risen in her
breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Lorenzo was a stranger to her and hers, and the little
that was known of him was disadvantageous to him, for
it consisted of the certainty that he was a pirate—an
outcast of human society. That was a sufficient consideration,
and when the full force of it fell on the mind of
the beautiful girl, she wept. She wept the tears that are
the bitterest—the tears that flow when we are called
away, by the dictatorial voice of principle and duty,
from the pursuit of some fond object on which all the
feelings of our nature are concentrated, and which we
had complacently looked upon as the magnet of our happiness.
On the one side she had her will and her affections;
on the other she had the danger of an ignorance which
was broken only by that which made it still more horrible.</p>

<p>Like one, therefore, who is resigned to death, from
the sheer insipidity of disappointed life, Agnes sat weeping
in her cabin.</p>

<p>The tears fell not with the vigour of energetic sorrow,
such as when the soul concentrates her strength to mourn
away with one effort some heavy grief, but they dropped
with the languor of oversettling despondency, such
as when even the full tide of anguish cannot wash away
the rooted sorrow.</p>

<p>She was in this condition, when the priest knocked at
her door and entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“Was she ill?” the good father inquired, “she had
remained so long in her cabin that morning?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but you are weeping: cheer up, child; come,
come, dry those tears: you are, I see, thinking of
home. Yes: there is a great difference between your
good father’s house and this vessel; but do not give
way to sorrow, my child, we must be thankful to Providence
for having delivered us from the death and dishonour
which, it is likely, would have overtaken us if we
had fallen into other hands, and we must not repine at
its dispensations in any instance: cheer up. Besides,
I have just been told to get ready to go ashore; they
will put us on land soon, I suppose, although I cannot
see it as yet myself.”</p>

<p>Agnes saw very clearly that the good father had mistaken
the cause of her grief, and was not a little glad to
observe that he had so readily attributed it to the
reminiscences of home. She remained silent. But the
priest had only increased her embarrassment of mind, by
the news which he brought, and which, he considered,
as indeed he himself had felt them to be, the most
joyful; for she learnt by his report that she was to leave
the schooner: she was glad, and, at the same time, she
was sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>She was naturally glad to be again restored to safety,
and to revisit that home with its dear ones from which
she was so nearly torn away for ever: and she was sorry
to leave the schooner, because her heart had already
begun to hover about it.</p>

<p>Which of the two feelings was the greater; judge for
yourself reader.</p>

<p>Duty, however, and even safety called her away, and
she must obey.</p>

<p>“When shall we go from this—when shall we be
landed, I mean?” she inquired of the priest.</p>

<p>“I do not know exactly, child, but they told me to be
prepared. But you have not, as yet, tasted food to-day;
they have brought our morning meal: I have waited for
you long,—come in and take some nourishment.”</p>

<p>Agnes briefly excused herself from accepting the kind
invitation of the priest.</p>

<p>“She was not absolutely ill,” she said, “but certain
thoughts had put her in a melancholy mood, and she
felt no desire for food.”</p>

<p>She insisted, at the same time, on his going to take
his morning repast.</p>

<p>He hesitated for some time to leave her, but was, at
length, prevailed upon to go, by her persisting assurances
that she was not ill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>Left to herself, the innocent girl gave vent again to
her tears; but she had not now any opportunity to
indulge her feelings, for she was soon aroused from her
sorrow by the re-appearance of the priest who invited
her to go on deck.</p>

<p>They went up together.</p>

<p>The long schooner was now lying on the waves like
some fish, that had concentrated its strength for a dart,
waiting for its prey. She rose and sank with the waves,
as she lay to the wind, like something that a more
powerful hand than that of man had made to inhabit the
element on which she so familiarly floated.</p>

<p>The usual silence reigned; every man of the watch
stood mute and motionless at his station; the captain
himself stood by the steersman with his arms folded
across his breast.</p>

<p>The schooner had been thrown in the wind, to wait
for the prize ship which was still at a considerable
distance, but which was approaching fast under the
press of her extensive sails.</p>

<p>She was, as we have said before, a fast sailer, but few
vessels could keep up with the Black Schooner.</p>

<p>When the two vessels had set sail together from that
part where they had remained since the fight and the
capture, it was found necessary to reduce from time to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
time the sails of the schooner that the ship might be
always kept within sight. Notwithstanding this, however,
the former had imperceptibly outreached and distanced
the latter, and it was now found necessary to put
her in the wind, in order to allow time for the ship to
come up.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the information that they would be
landed that day, the priest and Agnes could not see any
preparations which might indicate such a thing. Far,
however, to the east, land might be seen, high and blue,
and like a passing cloud in the fleecy atmosphere of the
tropics; still no boats were as yet got ready, and not an
order was given. In course of time the ship drew
nearer and nearer, until she had arrived within but a
few yards of the schooner, when she was brought up
heavily to the wind; her heavy canvass flapped, the
waves broke on her huge bows, and she lay like a
sluggish whale.</p>

<p>A boat was launched from the schooner and was despatched
with a number of men on board the ship. After
the lapse of a few moments, the cutter of the ship was
launched, and was forthwith rigged out, and the sails
were quickly bent. When this was done she was sailed
up to the schooner, where provision to last for three
days was put into her, and she stood ready for sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Orders were now given for the strangers to come forward
and embark.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, who had been in his cabin the whole of the
morning, now came on deck. His appearance was not
the same as it was wont to be. On his manly brow sat
gloomy care and anxiety, and there was even something
fierce in the expression of his lips. There was anxiety,
deep anxiety, furrowed in his looks, but there were also
marks of a deeper and sterner feeling.</p>

<p>When he came on deck, Agnes and her guardian were
standing almost opposite the captain, on the starboard
side of the vessel.</p>

<p>He saw them, but his eyes could not rest on them.
Was he bashful?—was he afraid to meet the looks of a
frail old man, and the timid glances of a helpless maiden?—he
who had encountered enemies that every human passion
had excited and embittered against him?—he whose
daily life was a continuous challenge to man, to the
powers that ruled the earth, and to the controlless element
itself which he had made his home? No, he was
afraid of himself: he was afraid of his pride. He
had never placed himself before in a position to
meet either slight or insult. He expected nothing
from humanity, and he never placed himself in a
way to be the object of its kindness or beneficence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
But love—love—the leveller—had now overcome him:
he had declared his feeling to a girl, he had, as he
fancied, humbled himself, by putting himself in her power,
and his pride was completely at her mercy. He therefore
feared to look at her, lest in her looks he might
read that which was—oh! more horrible than anything
else to his nature—slight, indifference, or contempt.
He had had a fierce struggle with himself at first to
write the letter which he had put into the cabin of
Agnes.</p>

<p>But he had no sooner done so than he repented of
his act. The mastery that love had gained over pride
was but temporary, it soon ceased, and he was left
to be crushed under the tyranny of that unrelenting
feeling. How many conflicts such as Lorenzo experienced,
are there not? How many hearts that nature
formed but to be united and to swell and beat but in
the community of each other, have shrunk, withered, and
dried away in cold and comfortless solitude, because the
love of another could not over-ride the fear of a risk, or an
exposure of the love of one’s self! How many a one has
traversed this beautiful world, and moved on it as on
the barren bareness of a desert land, with no congenial
soul to enhance the pleasures of existence by its
participation, or to diminish its miseries by its sympathy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
because pride forbad him to disclose to some loving
heart how much happiness it was in its power to administer.</p>

<p>These feelings, on the part of Lorenzo, did not arise
from any low conceit that he entertained for himself:
nor were they the emanation of that vulgar selfishness
that concentrates existence, the capacity of possessing
feelings, the desire of happiness, in one’s single self, and
there traces out their bournes and limits; nor did they
spring from the senseless and stupid vanity that bolsters
itself up in all the “pomp and circumstance” of its full-fed
ignorance. No: in the sturdy and the bold, such
feelings do not, cannot exist. It was something better—nobler;
something that could exist and thrive only in
the community of exalted thoughts, and delicate sensibilities.
It was a sensitive self-respect.</p>

<p>Lorenzo approached the pirate captain, and saluted
him. The latter returned the salute, and, at the same
time, fixed his keen eyes on his officer.</p>

<p>We have already said there was something peculiar in
the eyes of the pirate captain: there was something
that seemed to penetrate the inmost soul, and read the
mind, and see what was passing there. This power he
used on this occasion. The deep, earnest, steady look
which he fixed on Lorenzo seemed to overcome the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and his eyes bent before it. When the captain had
looked long and stedfastly at his officer, he turned suddenly
on one side, and seemed to contemplate in the
same manner, the fair Agnes, that stood still leaning on
the taffrail of the schooner, with her eyes fixed on the deck.</p>

<p>The captain had at once read in the manner of
Lorenzo, that he was in love with the beautiful captive.
His studious mind had long been exercised in connecting
deductions and his deep knowledge of human actions
and their springs, enabled him to trace, in one moment,
the change which was perceptible in the appearance of
his chief officer to its proper cause. He was at once
convinced that Lorenzo loved Agnes, and he now looked
on her with some interest. One would have said he
was examining her in order to discover whether she was
worthy of the affection of one whom he prized so
highly.</p>

<p>The examination lasted long, and Agnes was justly
alarmed concerning the meaning of this scrutiny on the
part of the captain.</p>

<p>The persons to be landed were now assembled on the
deck of the schooner.</p>

<p>The captain made a sign to the master fisherman to
follow him, and he descended the cabin steps. When
he had arrived into his apartment, he drew from a case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
a pair of pistols, and, at the same time, took from his
desk a purse of money.</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” he said, to the master fisherman,
“you have hitherto acquitted yourself well of that in
which I have employed you, and I have rewarded you:
now I require your further services.——I shall put you
and the captives in a boat in a few moments. There is
a young lady among them, together with an old priest:
you must take care of her, and protect her. There are
arms,” pointing to the pistols, “for you, the others are
unarmed. You, with these and the assistance of your
men, can defend her against the sailors in the boat, in
case any attempt be made by them to use the advantage
of number which they possess. There is your reward,”
pointing to the purse.—“But, first swear by God and the
Holy Virgin, that you will protect her at all risks.”</p>

<p>“Senor, I swear.”</p>

<p>“You shall be the master of the boat, and it shall be
yours after you are all landed. Beat up to the land
which you see before you from the deck. That is
Granada. In three day’s time you will be there.
Remember your oath. I never forget to punish.”</p>

<p>“Senor, I shall,” answered the master fisherman, who
had all the gravity of the people to which he belonged,
half by race and wholly by feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The captain pointed towards the door, and the master
fisherman was led away by one of the black boys who
was in constant attendance there.</p>

<p>When the captain had disappeared from the deck
with the master fisherman, Lorenzo was in a manner
recalled to himself. He looked about him, his eyes met
those of Agnes. His heart leapt. That look of kindness
penetrated his soul; the gloomy conjurings of his
pride vanished before it, and he seemed to be in the
enjoyment of something to which, up to that moment,
he had been quite a stranger. But, may he not have
mistaken that expression of the eyes.</p>

<p>He looked again and again—their eyes met. Oh, no,
he was not mistaken. He drew towards the young lady.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he began....</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” sounded the deep voice of the captain,
who had by this time come on deck again. He turned
round and encountered the reproachful looks of his
chief.</p>

<p>He went away from the side of Agnes, seemingly
ashamed of having given so much license to his feelings,
as to have neglected discipline for their sake.</p>

<p>The captives, the master fisherman, and his men were
ordered into the cutter, and the captain himself assisted
Agnes and the elderly priest into the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>The boat was ready to be cast off from the schooner,
when the master fisherman remarked that one of his
men was not in it. Jack Jimmy was missing.</p>

<p>“Ho! Jack Jimmy,” went round the cry.</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy “heard it, but heeded it not.” He was
standing with his arms crossed over his chest.</p>

<p>“Jack Jimmy.”</p>

<p>But he took not the slightest notice of the call. At
last one of the sailors perceived him, and looking towards
him, said,</p>

<p>“Jack Jimmy, will you come along?”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy still remained silent where he stood.</p>

<p>“Will you come along?” and laying hold of him by
the arm he attempted to drag him along.</p>

<p>“Massa, me no go—me no leave dis ya ’chooner as long
as massa in ea,” the little man said, with much determination.</p>

<p>“Will you come along sir?” and the sailor gave his
ear a twitch—Jack Jimmy passively let himself fall on
the deck, repeating—</p>

<p>“Me no go massa.”</p>

<p>But another sailor came up at this moment, and the two
of them dragged him along the deck to the gang-way.</p>

<p>“Oh! my young massa,” he cried, as he approached
the captain, “let me tap wid you, me no want foo go,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
me neber leafe dis ’chooner lang you ga—oh let me
tap wid you,” and he clasped the knees of the captain.</p>

<p>“Let him remain,” said the latter to the men, who
were approaching to drag him away again.</p>

<p>“Garamighty bless you, my young massa—me neber
leabe you,” and the tears trickled down the cheeks of
the faithful little man.</p>

<p>The cutter was cast off from the schooner, her sails
were set and she began to move through the water on
her voyage towards land.</p>

<p>In the stern sheets sat Agnes, by the side of her guardian:
her handkerchief was in her hands, and her head
was bent over the side of the little vessel, and now and
then she might be seen to apply the handkerchief to
her face as if to brush away the spray of the sea.</p>

<p>When the cutter was cast off, the sails of the schooner
were filled, and she was again put on her course. Joy
now seemed to beam on the fierce faces of the sailors,
and if they had not been restrained by the discipline of
the schooner, it was easy to perceive they would have
vociferated their satisfaction in long and loud cheers;
but, bound by the iron strength of her laws, they
could only manifest the feelings which then animated
them by a greater alacrity—if possible—in going
through their duties.</p>

<p>The captain had retired, and the command was left in
the hands of Lorenzo. That officer stood by himself at
the taffrail of the schooner, engrossed by his thoughts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
and anxiously watching the little cutter, that was now
labouring over the heavy seas, as she sailed gradually
away from the schooner, and was bearing from him,
perhaps, for ever, that being who first called forth in
him the power of that tyrannical sentiment to which
Lorenzo, like other men of a less bold and hardy spirit,
was subjected.</p>

<p>“She is gone from me for ever,” thought the officer,
“and has left me scarcely a hope. Perhaps, yes—no,
she will try to forget the pirate.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo strode gloomily away from the taffrail a
victim to a multitude of different sentiments, among
which the feelings of love, and those of pride in particular,
fiercely contended for the ascendant. He could
not contemplate a slight. To himself he was ever honorable,
beyond the stigma which the world would cast upon
him on account of his present condition, and even his
love could scarcely move him to forgive one that he
might imagine deemed him debased by the position
which he occupied; he turned away, therefore, from
the direction in which the cutter lay, and endeavoured
to call forth different thoughts by the study of a chart
which was lying on the binnacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>The Black Schooner was kept in the same course for
two days.</p>

<p>On the third morning, the island of St. Thomas’ appeared.
It lay far to leeward, and stretched under the thin
clouds, like the blue outline of some great slate mountain.
The schooner was again thrown in the wind.
The captain, who had exchanged his uniform for a suit of
plain clothes, now went on board the prize ship, and was
attended by Jack Jimmy, who had been permitted to
take his place with the two boys who usually waited on
him. The greater part of the schooner’s sails were
taken in, and arrangements were made for keeping her
to the wind, until the return of the captain. The ship
was now steered for St. Thomas’, and her large sails filled
with the morning breeze. She rapidly approached the
little island, which the policy and wisdom of the Danish
government have made the Tyre of the West Indies.
The English ensign was hoisted, and the ship entered
the little narrow harbour which affords a scanty shelter
to the numerous vessels that traffic draws to the place.
At that moment it was crowded with hundreds of vessels,
as different in their appearance as the various parts
the world from which they came. There might be seen
the heavy Dutch galiotte, with its crescent form and
huge clumsy proportions; the sprightly Frenchman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
with its light fantastic spars and long low hull; the
Yankee clipper, with its tapering masts and snow-white
sails; the Mediterranean faluchas, the sharp schooners
from Curaço, and the neighbouring Spanish coasts; all
these seemed drawn together for the purpose of commerce,
and numerous sailors were to be seen on board
their respective ships, busily occupied in taking in or
discharging the widely varying cargoes. A few other
suspicious low-hulled crafts, were also to be seen in the
offing, riding uneasy on short cables, and apparently
ready for sea at a moment’s requirement. The appearance
of those vessels at once disclosed the business in
which they were occupied. They were slavers, or
otherwise engaged in some nefarious traffic, in which
extraordinarily great fleetness alone could secure them
profit, or protect them from certain destruction. At
some distance from the town a majestic British ship of
war was also riding at anchor.</p>

<p>The prize ship was boldly steered into the anchorage,
and was shortly boarded by the officers of customs, who
demanded, in the usual manner, to see the ship’s papers.
The officers were easily satisfied, for the easy and
encouraging policy, which the Danes have been wise
enough to adopt, for the purpose of drawing trade to
their little island, did not require many forms in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
clearance of the ships which might enter its port. To
the apparent irregularities in the credentials it was
easily answered, that the captain was the owner of
the ship and cargo, that he had originally intended
to take the latter to an English market, but he had
changed his mind, and was desirous of selling it in order
to undertake a voyage to some other part of the world.</p>

<p>The captain, after this formality had been completed,
went ashore.</p>

<p>On landing, he was immediately accosted by the numerous
merchants and others who may be always seen loitering,
partly for pleasure and partly for business, in small
coteries, about the principal landing places of the West
India islands. The quality of his goods, as well as their
prices were eagerly inquired into, but no one seemed
inclined to purchase. He wandered carelessly about the
beach with the wide panama hat, with which he had
disguised himself, drawn far over his head, expecting
every moment an offer for his cargo; for it is in this
manner, and in such places, that the cargoes of ships are
frequently sold in the tropics. But no one made an
offer; and, tired of sauntering about uselessly, he
entered a neighbouring coffee house, and seated himself
at the table of the principal room.</p>

<p>It was not long before he was followed in by a young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
merchant who had detached himself from one of the
little groups above mentioned and had dogged him for
a long time.</p>

<p>“I shall give you fifty dollars a hogshead for your
sugar, and take all,” he said, as he accosted and bowed
to the captain, at the same time presenting his cigar case.</p>

<p>“No,” the captain briefly replied, returning the
salute, while, at the same time, he accepted the usual
West Indian courtesy, and took a cigar from the
proffered case.</p>

<p>The merchant sat down at the table too, and requested
the waiter, who brought the disguised captain a glass of
sangaree, to serve him with the same. He then took
out a cigar and began to smoke negligently, as if his
mind was as little occupied by thoughts of business as
that of a child.</p>

<p>They sat together for a considerable time without
exchanging a word—a circumstance of rare occurrence
in the talkative tropics, where men endeavour to find in
conversation the relaxation which the places of amusement
of other countries afford. But the disguised captain
was one whose looks did not encourage access, nor
was he one whom we would address by mere casualty or
for the sake of a moment’s pastime. Without being
repulsive in appearance he was from a general manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
that could not be easily understood, but which was at
once felt, sufficiently uninviting as not to encourage any
one to address him unless he himself was the first to
speak. The merchant therefore did not feel quite assured
and was by no means tempted to open a conversation
with him. The disguised captain on his part was from
natural disposition and taste, not inclined to exchange
more words with the merchant or any other person in
the island, than were absolutely necessary to the accomplishment
of the object which brought him to St.
Thomas—namely, the sale of the ship’s cargo.</p>

<p>But, if looks are in a generality of instances justly
accounted deceptive, they can always be considered so
with perhaps much more truth in the merchant, whose
business it is to assume the air of cold indifference, and
to pretend to care but very little about the transaction
in question, while perhaps his palm already itches over
the bargain which he keenly meditates, and while he is
perhaps already feasting in imagination on the princely
returns which he anticipates from it.</p>

<p>“Come, I shall give you fifty-five,” the merchant said,
after a number of whiffs.</p>

<p>“No,” the captain replied, in the same dry tone as
before, looking straight before him, indifferently smoking
his cigar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>The pursuits of his life time were so different from
those of the generality of men, that besides the stern
cynicism in which he had tutored himself, and the habit
of contemplation that he had cultivated, he would not
have been able to take interest in any intercourse with
them. Perhaps, also there was not a little of pride
intermixed with his silence. Accustomed to measure
the stars, and to associate his thoughts with the sublimity
of the heavenly regions, and raised to a proper estimation
of himself by the given opinion of the many universities
in which he had studied, and which had
declared him a man of extraordinary talent, he almost
scorned the intercourse of one who could speak to
him only about the state of the market, the amount of
money that certain individuals happened to possess,
and the other things connected with the occupation
of buying and selling.</p>

<p>Besides, he had long ceased to hold intercourse with
living men—except, indeed, when it was necessary
either to command them, to feed them, or to give them
drink. He had found that too much evil was mixed up
with the little good that he could derive from their
society, and not considering that the mere endurance of
the former was an object that was so worthy in itself as
to command the exercise of his fortitude, he thought it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
prudent to refrain both from listening to the expressed
thoughts of others and intruding his upon them. Books
therefore, he made his companions—books, that could
not deceive, could not betray, could not be mean, could
not be penurious, could not make to suffer, could not
disgust; but which contained the best of dead men’s
thoughts without much of their vileness.</p>

<p>It was not strange therefore that the two parties sat
together silent.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the existence of this feeling
on the part of the captain, his prudence suggested
the necessity of saying something in order to enact with
exactness the character of merchant-captain which he
had for the time assumed.</p>

<p>“You seem to have much traffic in this island,” he
said to the young merchant, in compliance with this
suggestion of his reason.</p>

<p>“A great deal,” replied the young merchant, “we do
business with all parts of the world. Never been here
before? Not traded in these seas much I suppose?
You do not seem to have been much exposed to the sun.”</p>

<p>The captain made no answer to the last observation.</p>

<p>“We have lately suffered much,” continued the merchant
after a pause, “in our trade here from a rascally
pirate that scours these seas. One vessel out of three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
is sure to fall into his hands. By the bye, you who
are a stranger in this part of the world, have great
reason to thank your stars that you have escaped him.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” the captain coolly observed and drew a
whiff of his cigar.</p>

<p>The merchant, also, drew two or three whiffs, and
continued—</p>

<p>“It appears the captain of these pirates is a very
remarkable fellow; he seems to care but little about the
lives of those who fall into his hands, but contents himself
with robbing them in a very gentlemanly and polite
manner. Those that pass through his clutches, and put
in here, tell such tales of him, that one would almost
fancy they had been spell-bound during the time they
were his captives.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” interjected the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes: and the fellow is so remarkably skillful that he
baffles all attempts to capture him, and always contrives
to escape. They say he deals with the devil; that he
knows his vessel, and his vessel knows him, for she does
whatever he chooses. Sometimes she is seen in the rig
of a schooner, at others in that of a brigantine, or brig,
or barque, or—God knows what else.”</p>

<p>“How remarkable!” observed the captain.</p>

<p>“By Jove! that is not all,” still continued the merchant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
“he is bold enough to take his prizes into any
harbour that may happen to be the nearest at the time—whatever
it be.”</p>

<p>“And has he never been discovered?” inquired the
captain, as coolly as before.</p>

<p>“Bless me, no! If he does not actually deal with
the devil, by Jove! the old boy always seems to help
him, for he always manages to sell his booty, and get
away before it is known that he had been there.”</p>

<p>“A dangerous man, surely,” again remarked the
captain, “I must account myself fortunate, I perceive,
that I have managed to bring my sugar safely into
port.”</p>

<p>“By jingo! yes——But, a-propos, those sugars, I
shall give you sixty dollars,” the merchant said.</p>

<p>The captain seemed to muse awhile and said—</p>

<p>“I shall take sixty, on condition that the money be
paid this very moment, and also in gold.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” cried the merchant, quickly: “wait here
for me a short time; I shall bring you the money,”
and he went out of the room, with the air of one who
was congratulating himself on having achieved an
extraordinary feat.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour the merchant returned,
and was followed by a servant, who seemed to be bending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
and groaning under a heavy bag of money which he
was carrying.</p>

<p>“There,” said the merchant, taking the bag from the
servant, and laying it down on the table, “there are
three thousands six hundred dollars in dubloons, verify
them.”</p>

<p>The captain spread the coins on the table, and began
to count them.</p>

<p>“It is quite correct—the sugar is yours,” he said,
when he had done so, and began to replace the dubloons....
The heavy footsteps of men were now
heard on the stairs. They grew more and more distinct,
and now they resounded within the extensive
room.</p>

<p>“There is your man,” exclaimed an individual, and the
captain, on looking round, beheld his father, who was
standing in front of a file of marines, under the command
of a British officer, who was accompanied by an
officer in the Danish civil uniform, that probably represented
the local government in sanctioning the forcible
capture of a British subject, by British authorities, on
Danish ground.</p>

<p>The face of the young captain evinced neither astonishment,
nor anger, nor scorn, as he stood looking with
indifferent calmness on the warlike intruders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“That is he—the pirate: seize him! seize him!”
cried Willmington, almost mad with excitement.</p>

<p>The officer remained undecided, and gave no orders.
He seemed surprised, and inquired, after the lapse of a
few moments—</p>

<p>“Is this the pirate?” and pointed towards the
captain. “I fancy you are in some error: this gentleman
does not appear to have ever left the land; besides, he
seems too young to be what you say he is: you surely
must have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>Nor was it strange that the officer should thus have
felt surprised at the appearance of the captain; for he
had expected to find some villainous, yellow-blooded
sinister-looking cut-throat, deformed, hacked with
wounds, and disfigured with gibbet marks. With this
picture of a pirate still on his mind, he had pointed out
to him a young man who seemed more calculated to pass
his life in quiet contemplation and easy enjoyment, than
to take part in the arduous and wearing pursuits of the
world, much less to hold the position of a robber on the
high seas. Besides, notwithstanding the hardy life
which he was obliged to lead, the young man still so
sedulously cultivated the refined habits in which he had
been bred, and had so carefully kept himself below deck,
that he neither presented the rough cast of men of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
rough usage, nor lost, under a tropical sun, the natural
paleness of his complexion.</p>

<p>“It is no mistake at all,” exclaimed Willmington, “I
know him well; I cannot be deceived. It is he who
had me thrown overboard. Yes, he had me thrown
overboard in the sea—to be drowned—to be drowned;
but providence has now interfered to punish the perpetrator
of the outrage committed upon me. And, and,”
he added, “you will now suffer for it,” addressing the
captain, while he took the precaution of clinging as
closely as possible to the officer. For it would appear
that even in the presence of the file of marines the recollection
of the empty cask made him nervous.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, good father,” the captain said, with cauterising
sarcasm, “the crime of throwing his kind and
loving father overboard, would better suit the jargon
that fills the mouths of such virtuous gentlemen as
you.” ... A pause ensued.</p>

<p>“His father,”—“Are you then this old gentleman’s
son?” inquired the officer.</p>

<p>“He can tell you,” answered the captain. “But I
await your orders sir; lead me wherever it may be your
instructions to do so.”</p>

<p>The officer seemed more undecided than ever. He
looked for an instant at James Willmington, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
remained silent, and bent his eyes to the ground as they
met those of the ingenious gallant young soldier.</p>

<p>“This is a strange and extraordinary business,” he
observed, “I am not aware that my commission obliges
me to meddle with such apparently disagreeable affairs.
However, young gentleman, for such you seem, and I
can scarcely believe that you are what this old gentleman
represents you to be, I have orders from my commanding
officer, and sanction from the local authorities,
to arrest you, provided you are the pirate who scours
these seas?”</p>

<p>“It is he—it is he;—I am certain of it: he took our
ship; he had me thrown overboard,” vociferated James
Willmington, scarcely affording the young officer time
to complete his sentence, “I tell you, seize him, seize
him!”</p>

<p>Disgusted with this uproarious outbreak, and somewhat
stung by Willmington’s imperative manner, the
officer turned round to him and said, cuttingly—</p>

<p>“Perhaps, sir, you would have me take a rope and
hang him at once: you must recollect, sir that I am not
bound to regulate my conduct by any peculiar activity
which may characterise your feeling against this
person.”</p>

<p>This language came the more readily from the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
officer, inasmuch as he felt a prejudice in favor of the
captain.</p>

<p>Free, frank, generous, and noble, as those of the
order to which he belonged generally are, he could not
but feel a certain interest in his prisoner, and he began
to speculate on the extraordinary circumstance that a
man, such as he seemed to be, should have found himself
in a position of so equivocal a nature, as the one in
which he was then placed. It appeared strange to him
that one who seemed well educated, and who at the same
time possessed such gracefulness of demeanour, and
elegance of expression, could have freely chosen to herd
with the wretched outcasts that usually crown their
other numerous crimes with the horrible outrages of
piracy: and should thus expose himself, not only to the
danger of the horrid death with which such a crime was
punished, but to run the risk of entailing upon himself
the ignominy which the world, with one accord, unanimously
casts upon the pirate. He justly imagined, that
to drive an individual, such as he seemed to be, to such
a life, there required very great causes, or, at any rate,
unusual ones, which may have acted in a more than
ordinary manner on a naturally too sensitive mind;
and as great afflictions always call forth sympathy
from the generous, the imagined misfortunes of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
prisoner turned, in an instant, the heart of the officer in
his favor. This was the impulsive judgment of the
young man.</p>

<p>The noble and fresh-hearted, young officer, that feared
not the prejudiced frown of any man, could afford, independently,
to take the man as he found him.</p>

<p>“You will go with me,” said he to the captain, “I
trust you will see the absolute uselessness of any attempt
to escape,” and he significantly pointed to his men. “I
shall not put you under restraint if you promise to
walk with us.”</p>

<p>“If you will take the word of a pirate,” said the captain,
bowing, “I promise to accompany you. If otherwise,
I am willing to allow myself to be put under any
constraint that you may think proper. I trust, however,
that I am incapable of showing myself insensible to the
indulgence of any gentleman, and least of all, to a British
officer.”</p>

<p>“That is sufficient,” quickly replied the officer.</p>

<p>The party now left the room, and soon reached the
boat that was waiting at the beach. They embarked:
and, in a short time, arrived alongside the huge man
of war, whose sides looked gloomy with the frowning
guns as they peeped through the port-holes. As
soon as the party gained the deck, the captain was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
immediately conducted before the commander of the
vessel.</p>

<p>He was one of those venerable looking old gentlemen,
who are now and then to be casually seen in the walks—of
the world, and who when once seen, forcibly draw
from us respect and honor,—with locks whose colour had
long been worn away by the wind and washed away
by the brine, and with one of those faces which tell by
their rosey hue and frank openness, in the evening of
existence, of a life so spent in duty and honour that not
one single repentant wrinkle dared ruffle the brow where
loyalty and truth had always sat. He was sitting in an
elegant state cabin when the officer brought the prisoner
before him. He raised his eyes from off the book which
he was then reading, and began to examine him. He
said nothing, but could not conceal the surprise which
he seemed to feel at the appearance of the individual
whom he was examining.</p>

<p>“You seem young to be engaged in such a lawless
pursuit, prisoner,” he said after a minute or two.</p>

<p>The captain bowed haughtily.</p>

<p>“You are aware,” continued the commander, “that
you are accused of a very heinous crime—that of piracy.”</p>

<p>The captain bowed again in the same manner.</p>

<p>“You know that is an offence which is universally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
reprobated by all nations, and it is one which in its
moral character is the blackest of crimes. It is my duty,
therefore, to keep you on board this ship until I can
put you in the hands of the authorities, whose business
it is to deal with these matters. I shall sail for Trinidad
in a few days, and you will remain in custody until
my arrival in that island, where you will be delivered up
to the civil tribunals.”</p>

<p>The captain calmly bowed again.</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” continued the commander, addressing
the father and accuser, “you will be good enough
to repeat, in the presence of the prisoner, the accusation
which you made in his absence.”</p>

<p>James Willmington, after a pause, then began, his
voice trembling with excitement, and ill-concealed
hatred.</p>

<p>“As I said before my lord, I, and two other persons,
were passengers on board the ship ‘Letitia,’ which was
bound for Bristol. We were two days’ sail from Trinidad,
when we were boarded by pirates, of whom this
man, as we afterwards found, was the chief. After a
brave resistance made by our crew, the ship was captured,
and I and the others were taken on board the vessel of
the pirates. The other captives were treated with
much lenity, but I was kept in close confinement, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
eventually, by the orders of this man, was even tied to an
empty cask, and set adrift on the ocean, to meet there a
lingering death, far more horrible than any sudden violence
could have inflicted. To prolong my miseries, a
few dried biscuits were tied to my cask. A whole day
and night I was in this condition floating on the wild
waves, and was worn out, and well nigh exhausted with
suffering, when Providence came to my rescue. A sloop
came sailing by, and with difficulty I made my cries to
be heard. I was taken on board, and life, which was
fast departing, was brought back by the kindness of the
master and crew.</p>

<p>“I had overheard the pirates speak about St. Thomas’
as the place whither they intended to sail for the disposal
of the ship’s cargo. I at once resolved to anticipate
them if possible, to have the author of my cruel
sufferings arrested, and to bring him to condign punishment.
For this purpose I prevailed upon the master of
the sloop, by offering him a large sum of money, to put
in here, where fortunately we arrived before the pirates,
and I had, by this happy accident, the opportunity of
watching their arrival. This is the man who is the
chief of the pirates, and who ordered me to be thrown
overboard under circumstances of such refined
cruelty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>After Willmington had spoken, the commander asked
the prisoner if the accusation was true.</p>

<p>“True in all things,” said the latter, “in all things,
so far as they have been revealed. I admit everything
that has been said, but my accuser,” and here he fixed his
piercing eyes on his father, “but my accuser has
informed you only of the punishment; he has not told you
why, when I treated my other captives with such lenity, I
practised what he calls cruelties on himself. Perhaps,
my lord,” while his lip could be seen to curl with scorn,
“perhaps he will tell you that I was only the executioner
who inflicted the punishment which one of the
most heinous crimes deserved.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” inquired the commander.</p>

<p>“Simply,” replied the captain, “that this man is my
father. He abandoned me at an age when I was too
young to offend, and afterwards refused me bread when
I was being famished. In vindication of the violated
laws of nature, I, in my turn, abandoned him when he
required my aid, and I cast him away from my vessel,
when he required its use.”</p>

<p>“Then you are this gentleman’s son? and there
are, therefore, family affairs connected with this business?”
inquired the commander, with evident surprise,
marked on his open and noble face; and, turning to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Willmington, he inquired, also, whether he was really
his father.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the commander, “it was wrong,
on your part, to treat your parent in this manner. If
what you say is correct, he has treated you unnaturally,
but there is One above us to punish such sins, and it is
not yours to arrogate the right of taking vengeance,
even when you consider yourself injured—recollect,” he
said solemnly, “recollect—‘Vengeance is mine, saith
the Lord.’”</p>

<p>“You speak, my lord,” replied the captain, “as I should
expect you to do; but you are scarcely a judge in this
matter: you have not had to endure what I had. I
can read in you, my lord,—pardon the personality—something
which tells me that, if you had found yourself
in my place, you would have acted in the same
manner.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, a young officer had silently descended
the companion-steps, and, hearing the voice of the last
speaker, he came quickly forward and gazed in his face,
seeming to recognize him.</p>

<p>“Appadocca,” he exclaimed, and eagerly grasped the
hand of the captain, “what brings you here? Why
you are not the pirate, surely?—it cannot be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I am the pirate,” the captain calmly replied,
while he pressed the hand that had grasped his.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! you deceive me—you—you—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Charles,” sounded the voice of the commander,
“recollect, sir, you are in the presence of your commanding
officer, and that you are speaking to a person who
is under arrest.”</p>

<p>The young officer retired a few steps, conscious that,
although he was the commander’s son, he was still subject
to the rules of discipline.</p>

<p>Deep anxiety for the prisoner, however, was marked
on his features, as his eyes wandered impatiently from
the captain, whom we shall now call by his proper
name, Appadocca—to his father, and from his father to
Appadocca again.</p>

<p>The prisoner was now ordered away, and instructions
were given to keep him in close custody. The officer
in command, the sentinels, and the prisoner proceeded
on deck. The young officer was about to follow, when
he was requested by his father to stay.</p>

<p>“Do you know this man, Charles?” inquired the
commander, when they were alone.</p>

<p>“If I know him, sir? every man who has studied in
any university these seven years back, knows Emmanuel
Appadocca. I studied mathematics with him in Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
sir; and, if you remember, you will find I frequently
spoke to you about him.”</p>

<p>“Yes: I think, now, I recollect something of the
name. But this seems a strange end for such a man as
you always represented him to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes; this does seem a very strange end,” replied
the young officer, “and I cannot but imagine that there
is some error in all this.”</p>

<p>“That old planter,” observed the commander, “seems,
however, to be very positive in his statements; and, in
addition to this, appears determined to prosecute him to
the utmost.”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped, sir,” replied Mr. Charles, “that
Appadocca will be able to establish his innocence.”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped, Charles—it is to be hoped,” said
the commander, and he took up his book.</p>

</div>

<p>Appadocca was led to a narrow compartment in the
gun-deck where he was locked up, and a sentinel was
placed at the door.</p>

<p>The unexpected turn that his affairs had taken, seemed
to have but little effect on his mind. The sad prospect
of being tried like the meanest criminal, and condemned,
perhaps, to an ignominious death appeared not to startle
his settled cynicism.</p>

<p>When the door of the cabin was closed upon him,
after having sat for a time in a deep meditation, he
knocked from within and asked the man who kept
guard without, for a piece of chalk, which, after some
delay, was given to him. With it he began to draw
algebraical figures on the boards that partitioned his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
cabin prison, and seemed engrossed in some deep calculation.
In this manner the afternoon passed. When
the short tropical twilight came and went, and he was
no longer capable of seeing his figures, he seated himself
down again and remained so until late in the night,
when he stretched himself on the deck for the purpose
of going to sleep.</p>

<p>He had not lain down long before the door of the
cabin was silently opened, and an individual closely
wrapped in a boat-cloak entered. The cloak was
immediately thrown off, and, by the light of a small
lantern which the stranger carried, Appadocca saw
before him Charles Hamilton, his friend.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Charles!” said Appadocca, affecting more
than usual lightsomeness, “welcome to my narrow
quarters,” at the same time, casting his eyes around
the close cabin, which, for the time being, constituted
his prison.</p>

<p>“Hush! Emmanuel,” said the commander’s son, “and,
for G—d’s sake, do not speak in such a trivial manner,
when you are in such a dangerous position. Tell me,”
he continued, while the most impatient anxiety could
be detected in his tone, “tell me how you could have
brought yourself to this melancholy pass.”</p>

<p>“’Twere long to tell, and sad to trace,” replied Appadocca,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
“as your own most noble and illustrious countryman
has it.... But you seem to be entirely cast down
with anxiety—bah! banish that, and if you can accommodate
yourself on this hard deck, sit down and we shall
have a little conversation on ‘the happy days gone by.’”</p>

<p>“Happy, indeed, they were, Emmanuel, and little did I
dream when we pursued our studies together, and when
I, together with the others, almost worshipped the intellect
with which heaven has blessed you, that I should
ever have met you as a prisoner on board my father’s
ship, accused, too, of such a grave offence as piracy.”
This was spoken with such deep feeling, that Appadocca
could scarcely continue his tone of assumed
gaiety.</p>

<p>“But what is this Emmanuel?” asked Charles, as his
eyes met the figures which Appadocca had traced.
“Calculations? must I believe that your cynicism can
have made you think so lightly of the sad doom which
hangs over you as to permit you to work equations and
solve problems at this moment?”</p>

<p>“Now, since you are bent upon being very serious,”
answered Appadocca, “pray accommodate yourself and
I shall speak to you, and as to those calculations, they
concern you more than you imagine. Let your ship be
in a safe harbour within these two weeks to come: a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
comet will be visible in seven days’ time, near the constellation
of the Southern Cross; the hurricane that will
follow at its tail, will be more than many ships will be
able to bear. Now sit down.”</p>

<p>The young officer sat down.</p>

<p>“You ask me,” began Appadocca, with his characteristic
gravity, which had now returned, “first, how it has happened
that I originally found myself a pirate, cruising in
the Caribean sea; and, secondly, a prisoner on board
your father’s ship. I regret much that even friendship
should have interposed to elicit from me a narrative,
which I have always desired to carry with me to the—scaffold
now, I suppose. Nevertheless, now that I am
on the brink of destruction, it may be well to let the
world know the cause of my conduct towards the individual
whom an unhappy accident made my father;—which
conduct, I admit, may now look strange and
criminal.</p>

<p>“You remember, when you left the university of
Paris, that I was then preparing to compete in the
<i>concours</i> for the professorship of astronomy.”</p>

<p>“Which I always believed you would have,
undoubtedly won,” interrupted the officer.</p>

<p>“Do not interrupt me. Within a short time after
your departure, I received a letter from the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
servant, who always attended her, acquainting me with my
mother’s death. You, who have known the more than ordinary
fondness that my mother and I so strongly entertained
for each other, can easily understand the overwhelming
effect which such an announcement had upon me.”</p>

<p>“I know, Emmanuel—pass over that quickly,” said
the young officer.</p>

<p>“Even my philosophy was not strong enough to bear
up against it, and I fell into a fever, from the effects of
which I did not rally for a considerable period.</p>

<p>“Well, with my mother’s death, my means of support
ceased; for she seems to have carefully concealed the
fact from me, that all her little fortune had been devoted
to my education, and had been expended for the purpose
of keeping me, as much as possible, on a level with the
station which her ancestors had occupied. I was, consequently
rendered incapable of continuing my preparations
for the <i>concours</i>, and it became absolutely
necessary for me to endeavour to gain my livelihood
by my own exertions.</p>

<p>“When the whole of my lifetime, up to that period,
had been passed in schools and colleges, you may easily
imagine that I was not much adapted to friction against
the world, and to fight in the scrambling battle, for bread.</p>

<p>“The only means I possessed was my pen,—precarious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
means! The only method of procuring food was by
writing on those subjects, with which I had, more or
less, filled my mind. Paris was over-crowded with
individuals placed in a similar position to mine, who,
however, possessed the superior advantage of being
better able to thrust themselves forward; a thing which
I sympathized too little with the world to be able to do.
Besides, it was very problematical, whether success in
Paris would bring me remuneration that would be
sufficient to maintain me in the manner in which I had
been brought up;—for you must know that literary men
are badly paid in France. I felt, also, a certain disgust
in remaining among those by whom I was known, when
I fell into a condition which, at best, would be but
precarious. For these reasons, I resolved to visit the
British capital, where remuneration was reputed to be
greater and more secure.</p>

<p>“I left Paris, after taking leave of but few of my
friends, and went to London. When I arrived there, I
found there were many subjects on which but little had
been written; for the genius of the English people calls
them a different way from the unprofitable consideration
of abstruse subjects. I wrote about these things. I
took my papers to the publications of the day. They
did not refuse them:—‘They would publish them,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
they said, ‘when there was room.’ That, I found out by
experience, was but an excuse. They were not inclined
absolutely to refuse the articles, so they had recourse to
that shuffling subterfuge, for they had their own friends
to serve. I waited long—there still was no room; sometimes,
at great intervals, a paper was published, but so
sadly mutilated that it became almost absurd.</p>

<p>“In the mean time, the small amount of money which
I possessed became more and more diminished; still I
hoped. Yes: I had that delusive, cheating, empty
solace of the afflicted—hope. Hope, which mankind
has complaisantly numbered among its cardinal virtues,
because it holds out to each the lighted wisp that leads
and leads him on until he finally stumbles into the grave
that closes up his existence. All my valuables were
disposed of, one after another, and I was at last left
without a brass penny—without property, save my
telescope. With that I would not—I could not part. I
should have more easily yielded up my heart than dispossess
myself of my old and only companion.</p>

<p>“Together with the letter which announced my
mother’s death, I received a casket which she requested,
at her last moments, should be delivered into my hands.
I had always been led to believe, that my father had
died when I was a child; but in the casket I found a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
letter, informing me, that he was not dead, and enjoining
that I should ever to study to cherish and respect him
who was pointed out to me as my sire. My feelings told
me at once, that my good mother had been treated
with injustice, and vengeance was my first impulse.</p>

<p>“I had always entertained peculiar opinions about
women: I had been accustomed to consider her the superior
of the two beings; nay, I had gone further: I had
considered her one of those benignant spirits which the
disciples of the theological system introduce in their
allegories,—the ultimate link between this condition
and a higher and more refined humanity. I had
looked upon her as the embodiment of goodness, that
sweetened existence with its smiles, and made sorrow
shrink into insignificance by its sympathy; as a being in
whom intellect and propensities were happily not made to
preponderate over the loftiest attributes of human nature—the
sentiments. Holding this belief, I had worshipped
her in whatever condition I found her;—in gorgeous
magnificence, or in sordid rags, as pure and spotless as
the lily, or polluted or stained with foulest crimes. To
me she ever was woman, and that was sufficient. On
account of this peculiarity, I always looked with horror
upon any man that could be base enough to take any
advantage of her, or give her pain. Such an individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
I considered unmanned and dishonored, and would shrink
from him with disgust. Judge, then, of my state of
mind, when I discovered that the crime which I abhorred
so much was brought so personally under my reprobation.</p>

<p>“In a calmer mood, however, I thought that sorrow
and restitution ought to suffice to obliterate crime;
that, at least, I should give the offending party an
opportunity of remedying the wrong he had done.
Perhaps repentance might creep into his soul. I wrote,
then, to the person who had been indicated as my father.
He was a wealthy planter in Trinidad. I made it
known to him that I was acquainted with the secret of
my parentage. I described to him the utter distress in
which I, his son, was then placed, and besought him to
send me a pittance to sustain that life of which he was
the cause.</p>

<p>“Months passed, and I received no answer. Certain
feelings began to rankle in my bosom; I, however,
took care not to be precipitate. Still hope sustained
me. I was obliged to pass days together without food.
On such occasion, I would stand by some thoroughfare
and watch the over-fed passers, and meditate on that
strange destiny which gave to some too much, and to
others too little.</p>

<p>“One beautiful night, the stars were clearly visible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
and I loitered towards one of the bridges that span the
Thames, to enjoy the happiness of watching them.
There, seating myself down on one of the stone benches,
I forgot for a moment my distress, and felt as I was
wont to feel in happier days. The night waned:—attracted
by the lurid glimmer of Antares, I fell into a
reverie on the theory of the starry scintillation. It may
have been one o’clock in the morning,—like the labourer
whose thews and sinews were relaxed with the day’s
unremitting toil; the great metropolis was buried in that
comparative repose which it enjoys only at that early
hour of the morning. The rattling of numberless vehicles,
the shuffling of thousands of bustling wayfarers had
now ceased. Nothing was to be heard but the soon-ceasing
rattle of some hurrying conveyance, the measured
steps of the police officers, or, perhaps, the ringing
laugh of some nightly merry-maker. My eyes were
fixed on the stars, and I was dreaming on the orbs of
space, when suddenly the low restrained sobs of intense
agony fell on my ear. I suddenly turned my head, when
I beheld a woman standing on the wall, apparently ready
to throw herself headlong into the river. She had a
child in her arms, and she pressed it to her bosom,
while she loaded it with caresses, and bathed it with
tears. Her sobs were those of despair. In an instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
I comprehended her intention, and creeping silently
along the parapet, I suddenly stood up and seized her in
my arms. She gave one convulsive shriek and swooned
away.</p>

<p>“I had taught myself to look on misery as the actings
of certain general laws: I had accustomed myself to
look upon the most appalling phenomena of organic and
inorganic life simply as the consummation to which they
must necessarily come. I had studied to bring down to
nothing the revolting aspect of misery, the bloody
scenes of warriors weltering in their blood, or the
ghastly hue of emaciating disease; but never before that
night had there been presented to my eyes such a combination
of utter misery, of gentleness, of innocence, of
suffering, of goodness, and of despair, as I beheld
blended in the woman whom I had thus rescued from
perdition.</p>

<p>“She was young, as yet scarcely of the age capable
to bear even the ordinary troubles of the world. Her
auburn hair floated loose over her shoulders and her
pale emaciated face, while the whiteness of her forehead
was here and there to be seen between her
dishevelled tresses. Her lacklustre eyes were as sunken
as if animation had already ceased; a tattered dress
hung about her skeleton frame, and her fingers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
were more like those of a dead than of a living creature.
The babe was as pale as the moon that shone upon it.
Its sweet little features were locked in a calm lethargic
sleep: its spirit seemed to sympathise with that of its
mother; whilst neither her alarm and swoon, nor the
bleakness of the night, could rouse it from its happy
slumber, or draw a murmuring cry from its lips.</p>

<p>“I stood for a long time, supporting the unhappy girl
in my arms, anxiously watching the return of animation.
Her circulation was slow, for want had fed upon her
strength.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, oh!—where, where—am I?—no—no—I
am not there’—she wanderingly muttered, as she
gradually recovered.</p>

<p>“Her head drooped in silence, as she became conscious
of her position and exposure. I questioned her
delicately on the circumstances that led to her taking
so fatal a resolution as the one which I had, but accidentally,
prevented her from carrying into effect. After
much hesitation, she told me the story of her misfortune.</p>

<p>“She had been left fatherless and motherless. She
had devoted herself to the man whom she had been
taught, by his ardent professions, to look upon as her
only stay, and whom she still loved; he had perjured
himself, and abandoned her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“She had hid her head in shame and misery from her
friends, and by incessant toil had sometimes procured
herself food: but she became a mother, and could no
longer work. She had pined away with her babe in a
hovel: at last to see her child daily droop under her
eyes, maddened her; she could bear it no longer.
There might be a happier lot, she thought, in another
world, where at least there were no deceivers, and so
resolved to flee from this.</p>

<p>“‘And is the father of your child rich, and able to
provide food for it?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>“‘He is,’ she replied.</p>

<p>“‘Recollect,’ I said, ‘that however desperate your
condition may be, still you have no right to take away the
life of your child. The little innocent has been brought
into the world by you, it is, therefore, your duty to
devote your life to its care and preservation.’</p>

<p>“She wept.</p>

<p>“I had no money—my coat was scarcely good enough
to protect me from the cold—I still had two buckles on
my shoes, with which I had not parted because I knew
their value would scarcely procure me a meal. I took
them off and laid them on the babe. ‘Those may serve
to get your child some milk,’ I said. She refused them.
I pressed her to accept them for the child, and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
having obtained a promise that she would never again
attempt to destroy herself I conducted her off the bridge.</p>

<p>“The history of the poor girl had made a deep impression
on me; I was agitated, so I retraced my steps, and
seated myself down again; but I could no longer study
the stars: the mother and child were ever present to
my mind. That girl was once happy, I thought. She
may have shone in virtue and accomplishments. Now
she is loaded with misery. And what has changed her
condition thus? was it the visitation of Providence?
was it sudden illness? was it her own crime? She had
fallen a victim to her own virtues, her own confidence,
her own fondness, her own gentleness. The angelic
nature of her sex, was worked upon for her destruction,
and after having been deceived, she was discarded,—she!
nay,—not she alone—but the innocent child—too
young to offend, too helpless to be criminal—was also
thrown on the wide, unfeeling world. Has one human
creature any right thus to load another with misery, to
drive another to desperation, to convert the life of
another—aye, and by a most villainous method—into a
period of enduring suffering and anguish? The man,
too, who hast blasted her happiness, is rich, and perhaps,
at this moment, when his victim and child are perishing
of starvation, is surrounded by his merry minions and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
lemans, and is squandering away that wealth, of which
the thousandth part would save his child from famine.
I could no longer restrain myself. ‘Great Ruler of the
Universe,’ I exclaimed, ‘canst Thou permit these things?
How is it, that thou, who hast filled the space, that
confounds human understanding, with such worlds of
beautiful worlds; that hast so wisely adjusted their
incomprehensible systems, that all revolve and move in
perfect harmony, and submit implicitly to the great laws
that Thou hast imposed upon them:—how is it that
Thou hast given such license to one of thy humble
creatures, that he, apparently uncontrolled, can stride in
wickedness over this fair world, and blast the life and
happiness which Thou, also bestowed?—This, at least,
is not wisdom!...’</p>

<p>“Hush! blasphemer, hush,” a spirit seemed to whisper
to me.</p>

<p>“Chide not Heaven foolishly! Thou sayest that
He has ordained laws to which worlds that thou
but faintly seest above, are subject:—that’s true:
carry thy reflections still farther. Thou beholdest above
thee, with the naked eye, orbs, in regard to which thy
powers of calculation are scarcely comprehensive enough
to keep pace with thy vision. To thy sight, when
assisted, these already uncountable worlds multiply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
themselves to numbers which thou canst attempt to
speak of only in ratios; and, probably, when thy ingenuity
shall have contrived to invent some instrument
that will assist thy vision still more, thou shalt behold,
open before thee, an immensity of orb-filled space, at the
sight of which despair will well-nigh seize thee. Consider
all these,—even the few that thou seest without
unusual exertion,—they all exist, move, and revolve by
the force of laws which are impressed upon them.
Contemplate their mechanism and order. Take this
one—it is the centre of a system, and stands the
governor, amidst millions of other orbs that are subject
and obedient to its guidance. It moves, and they move,
too, with and around it; and it is itself subject to some
other, from which it receives its motion and its law.
Those others, too, that so humbly seem to follow it,
are, each of them in its place, the rulers of others again,
that are less powerful than themselves, and give their
law to them. Each of these, apparently, disjointed parts,
and these numerous groups of world-contained worlds,
are united and cemented, under the all-powerful force of
law, and form a whole that is more incomprehensible at
the ratio of the unit of each, than its component
parts. Still, notwithstanding this unrealizable immensity,
behold the harmony and regularity with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
they perform their revolutions. In these gyrations, that
are as innumerable as themselves, not one clashes against
the other; and when they diverge the distance of even
a cubic inch, such divergence is ever exacted by the
necessity of the self-same law, which so marvellously
controls them. In the movements of these vast bodies
time can be calculated to the utmost second; and in
their inclination to a given point, towards which they
have been verging for millions of your computed years,
not a difference, except that which the known law
seemed to require, can be traced, either in ratio, or in,
what appears to your short-lived eyes, their remarkable
slowness. Here mark law, and obedience to that law.</p>

<p>“From the sublime regions come now to earth. Thou
mayest behold design and intelligence in the very
inorganic matter that composes it, from the consolidated
and hardened granite that resists and beats back the
rushing ocean, to the minute particle that blinds thee
by the roadside. Law is stamped upon them, and
adherence to that law, composes their very existence.
Again, the trees which shelter this beautiful globe tell,
in their germination, their bloom, their blossom, and
decay, of law and obedience.</p>

<p>“Proceed to organized things;—contemplate all
living creatures, from the low and torpid lizard that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
creeps upon the tombstone, and turns its cold and
clammy sides to the sunbeams, to the gigantic elephant—thou
wilt find that every animal carries in itself a law
and undergoes the pains of retribution whenever it
violates that law. Thus the browsing sheep that
forgets its instinct, and feeds on poisonous herbs, dies.
The scorpion, that turns his sting upon itself, also dies.
The antelope, if it throws itself down a rock must necessarily
be dashed to pieces. In all these things you
see law, and its safeguard—retribution. Man, as well
as all other beings, is subject to it, and the penalty
which its violation entails. If you establish false
systems among yourselves, and consent to postpone
to an imaginary period, this penalty, which ought
to be made to follow closely upon every violation of
the law, surely Heaven is not to be blamed. Duty is
poised between the reward of virtue and retribution:—man
has the license to choose, between either meriting
the former, or bringing down the latter, upon himself.
The great error of your social physics is, that you
remit this penalty to a period of time, which if it were
even unimagined, would fail to afford the principal and
best effect of retribution,—the deterring from crimes.</p>

<p>“Like those who dwelt on the banks of the Nile of old,
who built cities for dead men, and gave them kings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and made laws for them, and established vast prisons
and instituted judges, and sketched out places which
the most fevered imagination cannot realize, and surrounded
them with pleasures, or filled them with horrors,
either as happy regions where virtues were to be
rewarded, or frightful holes in which crimes were to
be punished, you permit the evil-doer to live his wicked
years, and sink amidst the weeping sorrow of friends
or bribed strangers into the quiet grave, then read the
lesson to mystified listeners—that evil deeds are punished.
If the wretch, who poisoned the life of that miserable creature
whom thou but now didst rescue, were made to suffer
the one-hundredth part of that misery which he has caused;
his mates in vile wickedness, appalled by the example,
would shrink in trembling fear from the perpetration of
like crimes. You forget, in your social system, the
wisdom of the race which you affect to despise, while
you cherish the theological philosophy which you were
eager to borrow from them, and tie the hand of the avenger,
and blunt the double-edged sword of retribution.
You punish the man who takes away the life of another;
who consigns another to the oblivion on which neither
misery nor pleasure intrudes, and him who makes the
life of the living worse than death, you permit to roam,
in his foulness, this beautiful earth, and only hope that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the retribution which you yourselves ought to bring
about, will be wrought by the very hand of the Being
who operates here but by his created agents. And then,
thou short-sighted, impulse-ridden, and reason-limited
mortal, complainest in loud and senseless terms against
Heaven, while at thy own door lies the wrong. Know
that man himself, by law, is the avenger, the retributionist
on himself or others.</p>

<p>“‘Ah! is it so?’ I said. I reflected, and found that
it must be so.—The scales fell from my eyes.—‘True,
true,’ I cried.—Heaven forgive the impulse of a short-sighted
mortal.</p>

<p>“Then this man, who may now be rolling in profusion
while his child is dying of hunger, ought to be made to
bear the stings of famine, too, and suffer the same misery
which he has inflicted on others.—And—oh! a fearful
light broke in upon me—and the man from whose hands
I demanded not existence, but who has given me life,
and abandoned me in my misery, ought likewise to feel
some part of the sufferings which I undergo. Yes: the
only prevention of crime is to make its punishment
follow immediately in its course.</p>

<p>“‘Then, hear ye powers above,’ I exclaimed, ‘this
miserable life I devote to vindicate the law of nature
which has been violated in me, and in your child; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
I swear, by the Great Being who gave me reason, that
I shall not rest until I have taught my father, that the
creature to whom he has given life possesses feelings and
sensibility, and is capable of taking vengeance.’</p>

<p>“I resolved, at once, to start for the West Indies,
and to go to the docks, as soon as it was light, to procure
a ship. So, on the impulse of the thought, I
proceeded to the place where I had my lowly lodging to
fetch my telescope. But, although I knocked loud
enough to awake the soundest sleepers, the door was not
opened; I, therefore, sat on the steps until daylight
came. When morning had dawned I again knocked, but
was refused admittance. ‘Then give me my telescope,’
I prayed. The telescope had been sold the night before
for my rent, I was told. I was overwhelmed. It was
natural enough the master of the house should require
his money, but I never could have contemplated that
my telescope would have been taken from me. Rallying
from the shock that I had received, I begged to see
the master. After some time he came to the door. He
was a fat heavy little man, whose voice came whizzingly
from his encumbered chest. I implored him to restore
me my telescope, telling him that it was my only companion
and solace in life, and I offered to work for him
in whatever capacity, how mean soever it might be, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the few shillings that were due to him, provided he
would give me back my telescope. ‘Go along with
you,’ he answered, ‘do you take me for a fool?’ and
shut the door violently in my face. I turned away, and
was so dejected in mind and wasted in body, that I
could not walk. The morning advanced, and the street
began to present the busy scene by which it was every
day animated. My musings imperceptibly turned on
the motly crowd before me. I contemplated the scene
in which there might be observed the shrewd cabman
driving to death his jaded horse, the affluent man of
business, hurrying with inclining head to the pursuit
of greater wealth, the afflicted widow, moving along
in modest grief; the age-stricken and poor cripple
crawling in his sordid rags, and the man of fortune
with his air of self-satisfaction, his dangling jewels
and his gaudy equipage. I remarked that these different
persons passed each other as if no kindly word or
salutation had ever rested on their heavy tongues—like
gruff animals that hurry in silence to their separate
lairs. Each seemed intent on his own pursuit. The
driver did not withdraw his attention from his horse’s
head, nor did the lordling stop to succour the decaying
wretch; the man of business did not raise his eyes from
the ground, on which he seemed to count his gains, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
notice the sorrowful widow: yet these men possess wealth
enough to render thousands happy without injuring
themselves.</p>

<p>“They have wealth enough to have my telescope restored
to me, and cause my happiness; still, yon
wretched being may—nay, will probably sink into his
grave for the want of a brass penny from any of these,
and I—I should probably be handed over to the police
officer, were I to make one more effort for my telescope.
‘Mankind, farewell!’ I exclaimed, from the
force of my disgust, ‘I may pity you, but never can love
you.’</p>

<p>“I then walked down to the London Docks where,
after some inquiry, I found a ship prepared for a voyage
to Jamaica. I offered myself to the commander as a seaman.
He began to depreciate my capabilities, and said
that I should, probably, encumber others rather than
be of any service.</p>

<p>“I told him that I could steer a ship, and take
observations; I did not mention my competency to do
the other parts of navigation, for I was afraid to prejudice
him against me; for individuals of that class
pride themselves on the idea that the great secret of
managing a ship, is in their hands alone, and that other
men are, or ought to be—entirely ignorant of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>“Finally, I asked him to examine me, on the mariner’s
compass, and on navigation.</p>

<p>“He readily did so, and the ignorant creature put me
some miserable questions, about the sun’s altitude at
noon, and some such matter which he had been mechanically
taught. I answered them, and encouraged all the
while the important and patronizing air which he had
assumed. When we have no money, and desire the
accomplishment of any purpose, we must learn to use
towards men, a passport that is equivalent—a sympathy
with their vanity. The result was, that I was
immediately granted a passage to Jamaica, on condition
that I should work it.</p>

<p>“As I sailed down the Thames and gazed on the banks
of the river, I became a prey to the saddest reflections.
Fancy had often whispered to me thoughts of a brilliant
and happy career. The lightness of heart with which I
began and prosecuted my studies; the happiness which
I derived from them, and my total unacquaintance with
the world, had never permitted me to speculate a moment
on the possibility of misfortune or of distress.
I had fondly cherished the hope, that in Europe, the
centre of the highest human civilization, I should have
been able one day to bring down some truth from
the stars to mankind, and should have crowned the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
labours of a lifetime, with banishing away some of the
ignorance in which the human species was enveloped.
But when I experienced the prostration of want—the
prostration that arises not from an enfeebling of
the body, or from a decay of mind, but simply from
not possessing the conventional medium of exchange;
when I saw that our most glorious enterprises are
subject, on account of a necessary evil of civilisation,
and the iniquitous habits of mankind, to be blasted;
I became persuaded that, without money, no man can
hope to propagate truth; and the difficulty of carrying
my projects into execution was forced upon me.
This, however, could partly be overcome. But as I left
Europe, I felt that all hopes of realizing my designs
were gone.</p>

<p>“The ardour which had, however, inflamed me in
one pursuit, fired me also in another, and to it was
added the force of unswerving necessity;—that of visiting
on the individual who was the primary source of my
sufferings, the same amount of them as I was enduring.</p>

<p>“But I find I am becoming prolix. It is now late—you
and I require rest; come again to-morrow night
and I shall let you hear the other part of the adventures,
which have ended in leaving me a prisoner on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
board your father’s ship, and a narrator to you of my
history.”</p>

<p>The young officer rose up, and, shaking hands with
Appadocca, bade him good night with that melancholy
sympathy which only true and disinterested friendship
can inspire.</p>

<p>The next night, about the same hour, Charles
Hamilton again betook himself to the cabin-prison of
Appadocca, who resumed his narrative as he had promised.</p>

<p>“When I arrived at Jamaica, I proceeded at once,”
he continued, “to San Domingo, where I knew there
were many at that time to whom the world was as disgusting
as it was to myself, and who, I judged, would be
the proper instruments to aid me in my schemes. The
French revolution had torn up whole families together,
from the soil on which they had been rooted for generations,
and had driven them to distant countries for protection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
and subsistence. They had carried with them, to their
new homes, a strong hatred for their then democratic
country, in particular, and for the whole world in general.
For suffering tends not to soften the feelings or expand
the heart. Pain, either mental or bodily, sours the
sweetest nature, and it requires the strongest fortitude
to endure it without anger.—Even Zeno strangled himself
when he had known pain.</p>

<p>“Among such men only who hated the world from
having, like myself, experienced injustice, I thought I
could live. When I arrived at San Domingo, I found
that even my anticipations were exceeded. I found the
exiles existing in a state of cynical philosophy, in the
midst of the virgin forests that covered the island.
They lived in rude huts, erected apart from each other,
which they called boucans. There they passed their
lives in the society only of their dogs, and of their
apprentices or servants, that jointly aided them in the
chase by which they subsisted.</p>

<p>“The instinct of active pleasure seemed entirely
eradicated from their hearts; for after the day’s work
was done, and they had killed the animal which promised
them food for a few days, they usually stretched
themselves on their bed of reeds, and sullenly smoked
away their waking hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“This life was so congenial to one who had suffered
much, that I should have settled myself with the others,
amidst the solitude of the wilderness, and would have
there prosecuted the studies with which my existence
was so strongly wrapped, if I had not a vow to
fulfil.</p>

<p>“How seductive soever I thought those boucans to
be, I was obliged to abandon the idea of enjoying the
calm quiet, which they promised, and to form a scheme
to carry into effect the resolution which I had taken.</p>

<p>“I was not long in San Domingo, before I met some
of my fellow students of the French University, who, as
belonging to the old aristocracy, were banished from
France. I found them disgusted with the arduous life
which they were obliged to lead, and fretting over the
destiny which had, with so little justice, deprived them
of so much at home, to allow them so little in their new
country. I availed myself of their impatience, and proposed
to them a life which was by far less monotonous
than that which they then followed, and which, beside,
was attended with greater gain—to say nothing of the
opportunity which it would afford of avenging themselves
on men, and not on harmless brutes. They
received my proposal with acclamation.</p>

<p>“On the spur of the moment we procured a vessel. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
was elected captain, and we went in search of adventures
on the high seas. I led my followers on wrecklessly
in action, and at other times, I kept them under
an iron discipline. The success of my enterprizes gave
greater weight to my position, to which I had been
elevated, only from a great respect with which it seemed
they regarded my character. I was consequently
enabled to develope my original plan more and more.
The time at last arrived—I sailed to Trinidad.</p>

<p>“By going ashore in disguise, and by a variety of
other means, I learnt that my father was about to take
passage in a ship for England. I watched the sailing
of the vessel, and captured her some days after her
departure. Then I effected that which I had designed,
and attempted to make him undergo the same miseries,
to which he had subjected me. Chance, however, seems
to have rescued him; and, as you see, through his
instrumentality I am now a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“And I hope, Emmanuel,” said the young officer,
“you will now consider your vow as performed, and
will cease to follow up this course of unnatural enmity to
him who gave you life.”</p>

<p>“Cease!” exclaimed Appadocca, “cease! men of my
cast never ‘cease!’ What I do, I do from reason: and
as long as I am under the domination of that power, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
need not fear that I shall ever ‘cease.’ I have long
buried impulse, and I endeavour to act up to the dictates
of the mind. Do not imagine that I could have sacrificed
my life—by the ordinary standard of existence but only
half spent—and devoted it to the attainment of an end,
and then stop, and fold my arms because a slight
accident has happened to cross me in my schemes.
No—no. Be it again recorded that I now renew the
vow which I made twelvemonths ago. I again devote
my life to the vindication of that natural law which
has been violated in....”</p>

<p>“Stop! Emmanuel,” cried the young officer, with
warmth, as he stood quickly up, and grasped the
uplifted arm of Appadocca, “do not—for G—d’s sake—for
my sake—for your own sake, make another diabolical
vow. Emmanuel, you must know you cannot but afflict
your friends by choosing to remain in this unfortunate
mesh in which you have entangled the intellect and the
heart that God has granted to you. I curse the day
that the name of this father of yours was ever made
known to you; it has led you to the perversion of your
natural faculties, to the branding of yourself with the
stigma of parricide—against which all nature revolts—and
to your flying in the very face of Heaven.”</p>

<p>And the officer seemed deeply afflicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>The captain still maintained his calm indifference, and,
after the lapse of a few seconds, said—</p>

<p>“Parricide—hum! and what would you have called,
perchance, the act of the father if the child had actually
died of starvation? what if life had ebbed from sheer inanition?
You look only on the right of the parent and not
on that of the child, who, be it said, has a double claim—a
claim that nature gives him, and one which he inherits
from the measure of kindness and protection that
his grandfather manifested to his immediate progenitor
when he himself was the child. You say, too, that all
nature revolts against the parricide—as you call it:
error,—nature revolts only against injustice. All things
are entitled to a certain measure of justice; and the
natural contract between parent and child is based on
the condition that, as the former has loved the latter, and
protected its infancy, the latter, will yield obedience,
honor, and respect, and gratitude to him. Where the
condition be not fulfilled, the contract, by necessity,
ceases, the child becomes absolved from his obligation;
and if he resents more than ordinary wrongs that may
have been done to him, he can assume, with all approbation
of moral philosophy—nay, nature calls upon him
to undertake the office of avenger, and to vindicate her
law. I am no parricide!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“You need not fear that I shall prostitute the faculties
with which you are pleased to say God has gifted
me; and, as for my flying in the face of Heaven, in that
respect you deceive yourself.</p>

<p>“I war not against God. On the contrary: recognise
in me but the mere tool of His justice. To believe
that the Almighty could thus look on, on crimes, and tie
the hand of the avenger, is to suppose no just God.
No—no, the only difference between your sentiments
and mine are, that you imagine He reserves his rewards
and punishments to be meted out in Heavens and in
hells—and I, on my part, can demonstrate, and consequently
must, and do believe that he uses a less cumbrous
machinery, and makes law—law which he instituted
and impressed on things,—the regulator of his
creation, and the vindicator of itself. No: as long as I live,
I shall make it the end of my existence to prosecute the
unworthy author of my days, until the world shall learn
by a dire deed that it is contrary to justice to give life
to a sentient being, then abandon it; and that all
organised creatures are endowed with sensibility to make
them feel, and spirit to make them resent injuries.”</p>

<p>“You have sunk yourself,” replied the officer, who
seemed more inclined to follow out his own opinions,
than to give ear to the arguments of Appadocca, “sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
deep in crimes, Emmanuel, without taking any
additional vows to load yourself more heavily with
them. You may have suffered grievous injuries, I do not
gainsay, but why should privations have led you to the
vile course of robbing and thieving?”</p>

<p>“Robbery and thieving?”</p>

<p>“Yes, robbery and thieving: for how otherwise can
I designate piracy?”</p>

<p>“Ha! I see,” replied Appadocca, controlling himself,
“I see you have either not gone far enough into philosophy,
or that you blind yourself to its lights. If I am
guilty of piracy, you, too—the whole of mankind is
guilty of the very same sort of crime.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by this?” asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Simply, that which my words convey,” replied
Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will explain yourself more amply?”
suggested Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Appadocca, “what I mean is plain
enough, and it is this, that the whole of the civilized
world turns, exists, and grows enormous on the licensed
system of robbing and thieving, which you seem to
criminate so much. The barbarous hordes, whose
fathers, either choice or some unlucky accident,
originally drove to some cold, frozen, cheerless, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
fruitless waste, increasing in numbers, wincing under
the inclemency of their clime and the poverty of their
land, and longing after the richer, and more fertile,
and teeming soil of some other country, desert their
wretched regions, and with all the machinery of war,
melt down on the unprovoking nations, whose only
crime is their being more fortunate and blest, and
wrench from their enervated sway the prosperous fields
that first provoked their famished cupidity. The people
which a convenient position, either on a neck of land, or
the elbow of some large river, first consolidated,
developed, and enriched, after having appropriated,
through the medium of commerce, the wealth of its
immediate neighbours, sends forth its numerous and
powerful ships to scour the seas, to penetrate into
hitherto unknown regions, where discovering new and
rich countries, they, in the name of civilization, first
open an intercourse with the peaceful and contented
inhabitants, next contrive to provoke a quarrel, which
always terminates in a war that leaves them the conquerors
and possessors of the land. As for the original
inhabitants themselves, they are driven after the destruction
of their cities, to roam the woods, and to
perish and disappear on the advance of their greedy
supplanters. Nations that are different only in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
language with which they vent their thoughts, inhabiting
the same portions of the globe, and separated but
by a narrow stream, eagerly watch the slightest inclination
of accident in their respective favours, and on the
plea, either of religion—that fertile theme, and ready
instigator—or on the still more extensive and uncertain
ground of politics, use the chance that circumstances
throw into their hands, make incursions and fight battles,
whose fruits are only misery and wretchedness. A
fashion springs up at a certain time to have others to
labour for our benefit, and to bear ‘the heat and burthen
of the day’ in our stead: straightway, the map of the
world is opened, and the straggling and weakest portions
of a certain race, whose power of bodily and mental
endurance, renders them the likely objects to answer
this end, are chosen. The coasts of the country on
which nature has placed them, are immediately lined
with ships of acquisitive voyagers, who kidnap and
tear them away from the scenes that teem with the
associations of their own and their fathers’ happiness,
load them with irons, throw them into the cruel ordeal of
the ‘middle passage,’ to test whether they are sufficiently
iron-constituted as to survive the starvation, stench, and
pestilential contagion which decide the extent of the
African’s endurance, and fix his value. This, my dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
friend is an abstracted idea of the manner in which
the world turns. But, as we used to say when we were
younger, and happier, ‘in generalibus latet fraus,’
allow me to descend to particulars, and to bring my
observations more closely home to society as now constituted.
In all the various parts which form its whole,
you will be able to trace the same spirit to which I impliedly
referred in viewing the conduct of congregated
individuals,—nations. You find those whom fortune
has called to the first place in the state, instead of
exerting their intellect to the utmost stretch, and expanding
their heart to its greatest width, for the wise
and virtuous government, and for the development of
the happiness of those who are subjected to their rule,
wasting their time in the pursuit of the most shadowy
gewgaws, squandering, in empty vanities, the tax-extorted
treasures of their subjects—treasures that could have
preserved the flame of many a light of humanity, whose
doom it has been to flicker for a moment in a garret,
and be for ever extinguished; or pampering their already
over-fed bodies to the point that sensitive reason refuses
to longer hold together with such masses of matter.
Those again in secondary spheres, use the authority with
which they are invested, not with the keen discernment
of delicate justice, but on the spur and press of passion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Is there some conquered people to be governed?—they
send their weak-minded, afflicted, and helpless friends
or relatives to govern those whose ancestors gave philosophy,
religion, and government to the world, but
who must now themselves stoop, to cut wood, and to
carry water, when, by the common rules of justice,
they should be permitted to enjoy the land from which
they have sprung, and to participate in its dignities.</p>

<p>“What villainous case is there, that with the ready fee,
does not find the well-turned and silvery measures of the
orator to palm it forth. The widow’s mite, or the
prince’s prerogative, may depend upon the issue,—’tis
all the same. Poverty and utter want may follow the
words of the cunning speaker, and rascality and villainy
may rise triumphant,—what matters it?</p>

<p>“At the side of suffering humanity stands the willing
doctor, and plies, and plies the rich patient with make-show
drugs.</p>

<p>“From the pulpit invectives flow, for the voice of
religion; charity yields to controversy; the denunciation
of other’s condemned and re-condemned errors supply the
place of the practice of benevolence; and in the name of
that Christ, who came with ‘peace and goodwill to man’,
evil passions are roused, daggers whetted, and massacres
sanctified; while he, who, with spectacles on nose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
and twang in voice, moves the ready machine, grins
in his closet over the glittering gold that his lectures,
invectives, panegyrics, and homilies, bring in.</p>

<p>“This is not all. Are you hungry? the baker sends
you bread compounded with pestilential stuffs, grows
rich, visits the church, sympathises with heathen savages,
and sends delegates to call them within the bosom of
his sweet civilization. Are you thirsty? the herb that
nature furnishes you for your refreshment is taken and
turned, and painted, and fried till it becomes poison,
and then given you with balmy smiles.</p>

<p>“The world can be compared to a vast marsh, abounding
with monster alligators that devour the smaller
creatures, and then each other.”</p>

<p>“Apply your argument, Appadocca,” said Hamilton,
“for I do not properly feel its force.”</p>

<p>“The application follows, naturally, my dear Charles,”
replied Appadocca. “It is this: If I take away from
the merchant whose property very likely consists of the
accumulation of exorbitant and excessive profits, the
sugar which by the vice of mortgages he wrings at a
nominal price from the debt-ridden planter, who, in his
turn, robs the unfortunate slave of his labour, I take
what is ethically not his property, therefore, I commit
no robbery. For, it is clear, he who wrenches away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
from the hands of another, that which the holder is not
entitled to, does no wrong.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” groaned Hamilton, “nice distinction.”</p>

<p>“To myself I am unstained,” continued Appadocca,
“notwithstanding the necessity that made me require
the aid of expediency. No man can say that Emmanuel
Appadocca ever fed his pirates with the lawful property
of any one.”</p>

<p>A considerable pause ensued.</p>

<p>“But it strikes me, Emmanuel,” said Hamilton, resuming
the conversation, “you forget, in your observations,
that commerce, and the voyages which you
seem to censure so much by implication, are the proper
stimulants to civilization and human cultivation.”</p>

<p>“A very vulgar error, my dear Charles, and quite
unworthy of your father’s son,” replied Appadocca.
“The human mind does not require to be pioneered by
Gog and Magog in order to improve. It is not in the
busy mart, not at the tinkling of gold, that it grows and
becomes strong; nor is it on the shaft of the steam-engine
which propels your huge fabrics to rich though
savage shores that it increases. No: there it degenerates
and falls into the mere thing whose beginning
is knack, whose end is knack. The mind can thrive
only in the silence that courts contemplation. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
in such silence that among a race, which is now despised
and oppressed, speculation took wing, and the mind burst
forth, and, scorning things of earth, scaled the heavens,
read the stars, and elaborated systems of philosophy,
religion, and government: while the other parts of the
world were either enveloped in darkness, or following in
eager and uncontemplative haste the luring genii of
riches. Commerce makes steam engines and money—it
assists not the philosophical progress of the mind.”</p>

<p>“I cannot admire this strange and extraordinary
theory, Emmanuel,” answered the young officer, evidently
disposed to terminate this startling conversation.</p>

<p>“You may call it strange and extraordinary, if you
please,” answered Appadocca; “but it is not the less
true on account of its novelty: it is scarcely to be expected
to commend itself to the world I know, because,
forsooth, it is new and strange: although the systems
and notions which are now as familiar as household
terms, were, once upon a time, quite as new, strange, and
extraordinary. Mankind is doomed to draw its venerative
and uninquiring self along. Science cannot
accelerate its unwilling movements. For my part, I
shall cling to my own doctrine, and shall give an account
of my actions to a Supreme Being, when the time arrives
to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Well, well, I shall not discuss such points with you,”
replied the officer, “I cannot congratulate myself on
possessing wits sharp enough to cut through your strings
of subtilities, I give up, therefore, these unprofitable
points: my instincts, I must declare, are against piracy.”</p>

<p>“Instincts, indeed!” partly interjected Appadocca,
“another stumbling block, and obstacle to science.
There are no such things as instincts in man: he alone is
distinguished from the rest of organic beings by the
indefiniteness of his mind and sensibilities. The habits in
which men are brought up, the notions of ignorance
which they have compounded and adopted they call
instincts, and thus saddle wise and good nature with an
amount of absurdities that would make her blush, if she
were conscious of the faults which she is made to bear
on the ground of having implanted, in the human breast,
feelings which are as ridiculous as they are false. As for
you, Charles, I am somewhat surprised at you. It is
clear you have not improved since you left the university.
The time that you had for contemplation during
your student’s life, ought to have produced better fruits
than an unconditional adoption of the vague notions of
the unreflecting, as soon as you found yourself among
them.</p>

<p>“Pardon the freedom with which I speak—our friendship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
alone has made me depart from the usual silence
which I invariably maintain.”</p>

<p>“No—no apology is necessary, my dear Emmanuel—I
know you—I know you! Besides, we have always
observed, that those who are endowed with a certain
amount of intellect, like the pendulum of a clock, are
liable to go as far from a given centre, in one direction
as in the other. But let us drop this topic, and
think of your safety. I have heard your story, and
really I am not surprised that such a sensitive individual
as you should have been driven by so much injustice
to a course which, with all my sympathy towards
you, I cannot but denounce. Appadocca, we have seen
happy and innocent days together, before either injury
had driven you into—into—crime, or the business of the
world had thrown part of its cares upon me: I could not
stand with my arms folded and see you tried like a
malefactor, and, perhaps, end your life under the hands
of a vile hangman: I have formed a plan to facilitate
your escape.”</p>

<p>“A plan to facilitate my escape?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am in high command on board this ship, and
I have men who are devoted to me. This very night
you will be put on shore.”</p>

<p>A pause ensued,—in which Appadocca seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
buried in deep reflection; while Charles Hamilton, quite
surprised by the coldness manifested on the announcement
of what he considered the happiest news to a
prisoner,—the prospects of escape—grew gradually pale,
and paler as the truth began to break upon him that his
friend, from some strange doctrine of his own, might
obstinately refuse to consult his safety, and to avail himself
of the means of escape, which Hamilton could lay
in his power.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few minutes, Appadocca grasped
the hand of the young officer.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said, “Charles, I esteem you too
much, and venerate the law of nature too much, to avail
myself of this kindness. Recollect that confidence is
placed in you; you are bound to use it scrupulously, else
retribution will surely follow any breach of it. I thank
you from the bottom of my heart for your good intention,
but I cannot,—I will not accept your offer. If I
escape, I shall do so without compromising any person,
least of all, one of my oldest, and most esteemed friends.”</p>

<p>“I was not aware,” replied the young officer, somewhat
piqued, “that I required to be reminded of the
confidence which is here placed in me: be not, however,
so foolish as to refuse my offer, let me entreat you.”</p>

<p>“Do not press me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“I stake my friendship on your acceptance,” said the
officer with some determination. “He who refuses the
good offices of a friend when he requires them, especially
in a case of life and death, can have no proper feeling
for him who proffers them, and he is, to boot—a fool.
Good night, Emmanuel,” continued the officer, getting
up, somewhat angry, “I give you until to-morrow to
think of what I have offered.—Good night.”</p>

<p>The officer went out of the cabin, and Appadocca was
left by himself.</p>

<p>A short time after the capture of Emmanuel Appadocca,
there might be observed a narrow canoe, with a
single individual in it, far out at sea, apparently going
still farther out,—for it was lustily paddled against the
long sweeping waves that seemed at every moment to
be about to bury the frail bark under their heavy
volumes.</p>

<p>The trade wind, which still blew, seemed to impede
the progress of the canoe, and it was evident that the
solitary person, who sat in its stern, found it necessary
to exert all his strength in order to make any headway.</p>

<p>But whither away such a frail vessel in the immensity
of the ocean, and still going farther out to sea? and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
what could be the design of the individual who seemed
to brave so recklessly the fury of the waves?</p>

<p>Upon closer observation it might have been
perceived, that the person who sat alone at the stern of
the canoe was our old acquaintance, Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>As soon as his master was captured, he had taken to
flight, but not with the design of abandoning the interest
of his young master, as he still called Appadocca. He
had managed to insinuate himself among the coteries of
boatmen and porters that skulked about the beach, and
unobserved among them, he had been able to watch
what befell his master. Effectually he saw Appadocca,
when he was marched down a prisoner to the boat, and
witnessed his embarkation. He discovered by his
inquiries, that the boat belonged to the British man-of-war,
that was then lying off the harbour, and heard the
tale which had by that time become a nine day’s wonder
of the place, “of a man who was taken by a pirate,
thrown overboard, picked up by a vessel, and had
come to St. Thomas’ after the pirate, and had had him
taken.”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy had now gained sufficient intelligence;
his own sagacity developed to him the whole extent of
his master’s position.</p>

<p>“Good bye, buddee,” he cried, as soon as he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
heard the last word of the story, and set off, at the
height of the speed at which his short legs would carry
him, and left his wondering story-tellers in convulsive
laughter at his apparent eccentricity.</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy kept running in this manner for nearly
two hours, without any abatement of the speed with
which he had started. Perspiration flowed in torrents
over his cheeks, and those who met him, stopped to
stare at the individual who was so eccentrically giving
himself such violent exercise while exposed to the
scorching rays of a vertical sun.</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy did not stop until he reached a secluded
spot by the sea-shore, where, at the foot of two opposing
hills, the sea had eaten away a deep recess, and had
left as in exchange for the land which it had robbed,
numbers of strange and beautiful shells, that paved the
place. Within this natural shelter, some fishermen’s
canoes were drawn up. Jack Jimmy looked around him
carefully, and seeing no one at hand, he walked up to
one of the canoes, and with two stones managed to
grind asunder the small rope with which it was fastened
to a stake, and then concentrating his powers, endeavoured
to launch it. But his strength was not equal
to the task: vainly he repeated his efforts—still no
success—he gave up the task, for the moment, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
despair, and sat on the ground and wept from vexation.</p>

<p>His despair soon gave way to a fiercer feeling.</p>

<p>“You must go in de water,” he cried, addressing the
canoe, and rising in desperation, he applied his strength
to it again;—it began to move a little, “Tenk Gad,”
Jack Jimmy cried. Again another strain:—it moved
again, and by little and little, Jack Jimmy got it nearer
and nearer to the water’s edge: by one long and straining
effort he finally succeeded in launching it.</p>

<p>He sprang into it as soon as it was afloat, tore up one
of the thwarts, and paddled with it vigorously out to
sea.</p>

<p>When he had got at a considerable distance from
land he stopped.</p>

<p>The sun was then sinking, shedding soft and sweet
brilliancy over the evening hour. “Yes, me ’member,”
said Jack Jimmy, “wen we lef de ’chooner, you bin
behind a wee”; and after having thus spoken to that
luminary, and probably made his calculations, in his own
original way, he steered the canoe towards the east,
and continued the powerful use of his paddle until he
arrived at the spot where the reader has discovered him.</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy held his lonely course on the great ocean
until next morning; when he discovered the pirate vessel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
at a distance. He redoubled his strokes, and made for
her. In a short time he had gained her sides.</p>

<p>Arriving alongside, he nimbly jumped on board, and
threw himself flat on the deck, with his face downwards,
and at the foot of Lorenzo, who was standing with a
spy-glass in his hand at the gangway.</p>

<p>The officer had perceived the small canoe, and on
using his glass, he had discovered that the lonely individual
in it was Jack Jimmy. His mind at once misgave
him. The captain is taken was his first thought.</p>

<p>It was with impatient anxiety, therefore, that he
inquired of Jack Jimmy, when he got on deck, what had
become of his master.</p>

<p>The little negro shook his head convulsively at the
question, and interjected, “Massa!” but seemed incapable
of saying anything else. Lorenzo waited a few
moments, but Jack Jimmy could say nothing more.</p>

<p>“Speak, fellow,” cried he with vehemence, “where is
the captain? Is—is—is he taken?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Garamighty,” answered Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Will you speak, sir,” cried Lorenzo with fury. “Is
your master taken?”</p>

<p>Jack Jimmy shook his head violently again, and
cried, “Yes, yes, Garamighty, massa, massa!” he
continued, “big, big English ship, take massa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“And where is the ship?”</p>

<p>“In St. Thomas’, massa,” answered Jack Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Make sail,” was Lorenzo’s immediate command;
“keep her way.”</p>

<p>The schooner immediately sheered off to the wind,
and in an instant was bounding over the waves for St.
Thomas’.</p>

<p>When she neared the island, Lorenzo prudently cast
her in the wind, and remained lying too until it was
dark, at which time he drew nearer the harbour, and
making use of a boat, recognoitred the “big English
ship,” as Jack Jimmy had described it.</p>

<p>After the officer had properly examined the large ship-of-war
which held his chief captive, and had managed
to elicit further and more explicit information from Jack
Jimmy, whose excitement of nerves had now a little
subsided, he began to think of the measures which he
ought to take to effect the liberation of his friend and
superior. His first impulse was to fife to arms, to
attack the huge fabric, whose very sides seemed to frown
destruction on the light schooner. Prudence, on reflection,
however, forbad such a step. There was too great
disproportion between the large ship and the small craft
of the pirates, and between the armament and complement
of the one and of the other; and even if, by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
fierce and sudden assault, the pirates should carry the
man-of-war, what chance was there of rescuing the
chief? Probably he was secured in some deep recess
below decks, whither, perhaps, even the roar of the
ship’s guns could scarcely echo; and if even the comparatively
few men that composed the crew of the
schooner, could gain any advantage over the four-times
more numerous complement of the ship, it could only
amount to a mere temporary possession of the upper deck.
Besides, the whole harbour, on the event of a combat,
would be alarmed, and it was probable that the pirates,
even if victors, would be entirely unable to contend
against the multitudes which would be dispatched
against them from the shore. “No, I must try other
means,” thought the officer. After much deliberation,
he at last resolved on the plan of watching the ship-of-war,
and of discovering, by every possible means, in
what part of the vessel Appadocca was confined, so that
he might attempt a surreptitious entry on board, and
carry away the prisoner.</p>

<p>For that purpose he sent three men ashore in disguise,
that they might procure as much information as possible.
These were not long at a loss in devising means for
doing so.</p>

<p>The pirate schooner was manned by individuals who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
had been of a superior class in society, before they exiled
themselves from it. Chiefly men of education, they were
doubly dangerous in their illicit pursuits, inasmuch as
they could bring to bear upon their purposes, the
assistance of art, and the power of inventing.</p>

<p>They easily disguised themselves when they were
a-shore, as vendors of fruit, and as the other small dealers
that may be seen of a-morning, in their little canoes
around the ships at anchor, in the ports of the tropics.</p>

<p>In their assumed course of bartering, they managed
to elicit from the sailors of the man-of-war, intelligence
about Appadocca, and the part of the vessel in which he
was confined.</p>

<p>As soon as they became possessed of as much information
as they possibly could procure, they returned
on board the schooner, and carefully narrated the sum
of their observation to Lorenzo.</p>

<p>Return we now to Appadocca himself.</p>

<p>The period accorded by the friendship of Charles
Hamilton to the prisoner, for the acceptance or rejection
of his offer to become the means of his escape, had now
expired, and the two young friends were sitting together
in the cabin-prison in which Appadocca was confined.</p>

<p>“So you will not consent to put aside your insane
notions and escape, when I place it in your power to do
so?” said Charles Hamilton, dejectedly, and, at the
same time, somewhat scornfully, twisting his whiskers.</p>

<p>“No!” replied Appadocca with much decision.</p>

<p>“Then,” replied the officer, “I shall have nothing
farther to do with you; they may hang you, quarter
you, and do, G—d knows what else to you.”</p>

<p>“As for that matter,” answered Appadocca, affecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
something like the same satire as his friend had used,
“you may exercise your own discretion; but is it not a
little absurd that, because I am not willing to sanction
the mis-use of the authority which you possess on board
your father’s ship, in your allowing me, who have been
brought here a prisoner, to escape, that I, on that
account, should lose your favor, and cease to be deemed
worthy of your notice, even if I should happen to be
hanged, quartered, and done G—d knows what else
to?” and Appadocca smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“This is the second time, Emmanuel, that you have
adverted to my authority on board this ship, and reflected
on my conduct in endeavouring to befriend you: I hope
it may be the last. You must recollect that I am an
Englishman, and an English officer, and I consider
that I possess as delicate a sense of honor and as great
a knowledge of duty as any gentleman whosoever.”</p>

<p>“And I,” replied Appadocca, “I am an animal,—sub-kingdom,
vertebrata, genus homo, and species,—‘tropical
American;’ naturalists lay my habitat all over
the world, and declare me omnivorous. I do not pride
myself on possessing merely such an indefinite thing as
sense of honor, or great knowledge of duty; but observation
has made me acquainted with the universal laws
which nature has imposed upon us in order to secure to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
us contentment and happiness; and your wishing to
make your station on board this vessel subservient to
my escape is in opposition to one of those laws, the
certain precursor of your own unhappiness, I shall not
consent to it. Speak to me no more on this subject.”</p>

<p>“If, Emmanuel, I had considered that my good faith
was concerned in making an offer of escape to you, you
may rely upon it. I should neither have attempted to
lower myself in my own estimation, nor should I have
subjected myself to the animadversion of your nice and
exquisite philosophy. I shall use the same liberty of
speech as you have done, and assume the right of telling
you, that His Majesty’s ship, which my father has the
honour to command, was built, fitted out, and sent to
sea, for the purpose of fighting the enemies of England,
and not for the purpose of scavenging for pirates and
freebooters: my commission was granted for the same
purpose. I consider, therefore, that this vessel ought
not to be made the lock-up of accused individuals; nor
ought my father be obliged to abet and to assist the
malice of hard-hearted planters, or interfere in the actions
of strangely arguing sons—I therefore consider myself
bound by no honour in this affair; and I am, consequently,
free to act as I please. I recognize in you
my ancient and respected friend, and I offer you my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
assistance to escape. You may accept it or not—this
is Saxon.”</p>

<p>Charles Hamilton spoke this with considerable
warmth and seriousness.</p>

<p>“Bravely spoken, Charles,” said Appadocca, “and,
although part of your speech may have sounded harsh
to ears more unwilling than mine to hear the truth, still
I admire you for it. Why did you not speak out
in this manner before. You may depend upon it, man,
it is always better to express one-self boldly, throw aside
expediency, and bring out the truth, which, though
harsh and unpleasant, is, nevertheless, the truth, and
must be told. What is there to be feared? A proper
man has nothing worth keeping, which he should
apprehend to lose, save his honour and his spirit of
rectitude. What though interest-seekers quake in
their coats lest their smoothly-varnished opinions should
not draw the approbation of their fastidious patrons: a
man, worthy of the name, must follow out the spirit of
his manliness, and that is all. Take the furious bull—society,
by the horns, and though its lurid eyes shine
fire upon you, nay, though it gore you, shout out
your truths still higher than its bellowings; and when
its madness-fit is over, your truths shall live, nay, ride
it even as a broken-spirited ass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“Men of such boldness there have been, who, Lycurgus-like,
have exiled themselves from all to throw
their truths into the world. Society may have branded
them, starved them, cursed them, and driven them into
hovels, there to perish and to rot, but they have ever
re-risen in their thoughts, and now their names receive,
on the bended knee, the unbounded veneration of
mankind.</p>

<p>“Still I will not accept your proposal.”</p>

<p>“But for G—d’s sake, Emmanuel, speak seriously,”
said Hamilton, hastily, “you surely do not intend to let
this obstinacy of yours prevent your escape;” and the
young officer looked anxiously in Appadocca’s face.</p>

<p>It would appear that, notwithstanding the previous
refusal of his friend, he never contemplated but that at
the last moment he would avail himself of his assistance
and escape.</p>

<p>“Call me obstinate, as you may,” replied Appadocca,
“I shall not accept your offer.”</p>

<p>“Then is it possible that you seriously refuse to save
your life?”</p>

<p>“Not I, by Heaven,” replied Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Then why not adopt my proposal at once?”</p>

<p>“Because my doing so will not only involve a breach
of discipline, but will also compromise your honour,—two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
sacrifices which we must pronounce disproportioned,
when we consider the very small necessity that demands
them.”</p>

<p>“Do you recollect that death will be your sentence?”
eagerly demanded Charles.</p>

<p>“I do recollect it,” answered Appadocca. “And
pray, what is death?”</p>

<p>The latter part of the question was put with such
cynical coldness, that Charles Hamilton found himself
unwittingly silenced.</p>

<p>He remained tongue-tied for a few moments, and with
the greatest embarrassment repeated the question of
Appadocca. “What is death, you ask?”</p>

<p>“Ay, what is death, I ask? let your embarrassment
repeat the question,” remarked Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Why, death,” replied the young officer, “death is—is—is
the—the highest of all—of all human punishments—and
sufferings.”</p>

<p>“Remarkably fine,” replied Appadocca, with some
satire, “remarkably fine, I once entertained better hopes
of you, Charles Hamilton, when you were at College;
but now I find, that like all other persons, you have
thought, that it was necessary to cultivate the intellect,
only during the time when you were at college,—that
you were to live in mind, or rather, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
dictates of your reason, as long as you were there; but
that as soon as you became emancipated from your
scholastic thraldom, throwing aside convictions, you
were to live entirely in body, merely copying the bad
habits of most men, which they self-deludingly style
instincts. You speak and think absolutely like those
animals that are driven above decks there by your orders,
and who turn their tobacco in their cheeks, bellow forth
their strange and meaningless oaths, and pull the ropes,
by precisely the same moving power as one of your guns
sends forth its iron and brimstone charge, when fire is
applied to the touch-hole. That distinguishing essential
which we, with so much complaisance, place on ourselves,
to divide us from quadrupeds and our other fellow
habitants of this earth—reason, is as much consulted as
the stars. You observe the whole of organized life
clinging to the idea of preservation, that they may
continue for a brief period the state in which they
happen to find themselves, and permitting this idea, in
sympathy with the herd of men, to grow unreasoned
in you, you fancy that I, also, should start from death with
the same fear, and consent to depart from the course of
conduct which my intellect prescribes to me, for the mere
purpose of avoiding it. You do not consider what really
is life, and less, perhaps, what is death. If millions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
men are content to cultivate a sluggish existence, and
shrink from ennobling enterprizes, in order that they
may avoid this bugbear with which they ignorantly
frighten themselves; nay, if they can be worked upon
by this terror to compromise the only imperishable part
of our nature—the idea of self-respect or honour—you
must not fancy that I, my dear Charles, am willing to
do so, too!”</p>

<p>“If you are not, I can only say your instincts are
ajar,” observed the young officer, who felt himself again
unable to answer Appadocca.</p>

<p>“There, you speak of instincts again: I have no
instincts. If you mean certain ideas which are the
necessary fruits of my organization, I shall observe, that
far from their being ajar, they, on the contrary, are the
only ones which are in harmony with whatever we know
of nature and of its author.”</p>

<p>“Hold, Emmanuel, do not go any further, you will
be guilty of irreverence.”</p>

<p>“Irreverence! it is not I who can be guilty of irreverence,
it is you, and the rest of the ignorant world,
that are ‘guilty of irreverence;’ for, by surrounding
death with the terror you do, and by considering it the
greatest of earth’s afflictions, you effectually depreciate
the goodness and consistency of the maker of all
things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“In what manner?” inquired the officer.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, and you shall hear. The whole of
this globe, you are aware, is animated. Every object
here, from the fibrous and silken down that flies about,
carrying the seed of some gigantic tree, to the mountains
of consolidated rock, is the theatre of life; and that
theatre itself possesses a peculiar animation of its own, or
laws of self-development. The various forms and shapes
which people these things, vary in their periods of existence
from centuries to the incalculable and indivisible
points of time, which human ingenuity has hitherto
deemed it idle to note. You have the birds of the desert,
the huge animals whose years are to be counted but by
the hundred; you have again the infinitesimal insect,
which comes into existence this moment to depart the
next; so that in the shortest space of time that
man can calculate, nature ushers into life millions
of millions of sentient beings, to sweep them away again
with the same rapidity with which they are made.
This earth on which this process takes place has existed,
as far as we can discover with certainty, for several
thousands of years, so that millions of millions of beings
have continually perished during every short moment
into which the numberless days of those thousands of
years can possibly be divided. To consider that death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
is so dreadful as it is supposed to be, when we find it on
such an amazingly extensive scale, and principally,
also, among creatures whose only apparent happiness is
the mere possession of life itself, is to call the Ordainer
of these things cruel—which is untrue, or, as we used
to say long ago, ‘reductio ad absurdum.’ What you
choose to convert into the horrible and dreadful, is only
the working of a wise and general law—that of transition:
we live here to-day in one shape, to live to-morrow
in a different one. Man has stupidly shut his eyes to
this fact as he has done to many other things, and pitifully
mourns over the action of a universal and useful
law.”</p>

<p>“Emmanuel, I am a plain sailor, and do not pretend
to deal in niceties of logical distinction,” replied Charles,
“and although it is not my purpose to continue this
very peculiar conversation, still I must ask, if our death
is merely a transition from one state to another, how is
it, that when we have entered into our new condition,
we do not retain any consciousness of our previous
existence.”</p>

<p>“The answer is plain enough,” answered Appadocca,
“when the harp is unstrung the sounds depart: when
we change from one condition to another, we necessarily
cease to be of the first, else there should be no change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
at all: and as our consciousness of that condition was
merely a natural consequence or effect of it, it follows,
that when the cause ceases, the effect must necessarily
cease also.”</p>

<p>Appadocca remained silent for a while.</p>

<p>“And as for the ignominy,” he continued, “of a death
on the scaffold, for such a crime as the one which is
imputed to me, it is purely ridiculous. It is not because
mankind may be eager to alter, by their vote, the nature
of things, that these things become intrinsically
changed.”</p>

<p>Appadocca stopped, apparently expecting Charles
Hamilton to speak; but he, however, was anxiously
gazing on the side of the ship, and was apparently
intent on listening to some sound that it seemed he
heard.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he at last asked, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Hush!—do you not hear that sound?”</p>

<p>“Hum! Perhaps—I think I do; I think—I—I—hum!
I—know it,” answered Appadocca, while his
face brightened up a little.</p>

<p>The officer drew nearer to the side of the ship to
listen—Appadocca remained where he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>The dull sounds of muffled instruments could now be
distinctly heard. From its direction, it could be easily
discovered that these instruments were applied to the
dead light, which had been carefully battened in for
greater security against the prisoner’s escape. The
sounds continued, and the sharp point of a large chisel,
with which some individual from the outside was endeavouring
to wrench away part of the cover, was now seen
through the dead light of the ship.</p>

<p>The young officer looked round inquiringly at Appadocca,
but met, in the gaze of that individual, only the
coldness that characterised him.</p>

<p>“An attack, an attack!” he cried, and rushed out
of the cabin. His instincts, as he called them, at
once belying the ingenious arguments with which he
had lulled his spirit of honor, when his friendship for
Appadocca interposed.</p>

<p>He arrived on deck in time to hear the sharp challenge
of the marine on duty.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” no answer was made to the challenge.</p>

<p>The guard was called out. The marine fired. In
return only a derisive shout arose from a boat that was
now moving away in the darkness. One, two, three
volleys were fired in succession, when the angry voice
of a man was heard from the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“Cowards!” he cried, “come after us, and do not
expend your ammunition foolishly.”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Lorenzo.</p>

<p>On hearing the reports of the spies that he had sent
on shore, that faithful officer had formed the plan of
carrying Appadocca silently away from the cabin in
which he was confined. For that purpose, he had
waited until the night was far spent, and with a few
trusty men had cautiously approached the man-of-war.</p>

<p>The pirate party came in a boat that was greased all
over on the outside, and which was propelled by
muffled oars.</p>

<p>The men were all dressed in black, and wore for the
occasion, dark woollen caps, which were drawn over their
heads so as perfectly to conceal their faces. They had
boarded the ship for about half an hour, and two men
were working away vigorously; the blows of the covered
mallet drove their muffled chisels more and more
deeply into the chinks of the dead light.</p>

<p>“Have you nearly got through, Gustave?” inquired
Lorenzo, the enterprising officer of Appadocca.</p>

<p>“Nearly, senor,” answered the man.</p>

<p>“Thanks to Providence,” muttered Lorenzo, “Appadocca
will be rescued.”</p>

<p>O disappointment wherefore dost thou exist? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
words had scarcely escaped Lorenzo when a splashing
noise was heard near the man-of-war.</p>

<p>The sailors, as is customary with them, when their
ship is at anchor, in order to improve their opportunities,
had hung out a fishing line. As adverse fate would
have it, at the very moment when the party of Lorenzo
was about completing a breach in the cabin in which
their captain was confined, a large shark happened to
take the bait. Pricked by the hook, the fish began
to swim furiously around the ship, beating about with
its huge tail. The water immediately became covered
with foam, and the noise increased more and more.</p>

<p>“Jump up, Domingo,” said Lorenzo, when he perceived
the imminent danger of discovery which they ran
from the noise that the creature was making in the
water, “jump up and cut away that cursed thing.”</p>

<p>But it was too late: attracted by the splashes made
by the shark, the sentinel looked over the bulwarks, and
perceived the man that was just sliding himself down
the chains of the man-of-war, after having dexterously
cut away the line by which the fish was caught.</p>

<p>The pirates had no alternative but flight, and they
were quickly making away when the young officer
got on deck.</p>

<p>Part of the crew of the large vessel was called out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
the boats were manned, and sent after the mysterious
visitors. But it was of no avail: those who had gone
in chase shortly afterwards returned, and reported that
they could discover nothing of the boat.</p>

<p>The circumstance was duly reported to the commander.
After much consideration on such a mysterious
adventure, the latter wisely concluded that the party of
the pirate captain were in those waters, and that their
approach to the ship was for the purpose of attempting
his rescue.</p>

<p>Further, on examination, marks of the tools were
made out on the deadlight of Appadocca’s cabin. He
himself was narrowly questioned, but he stated with
perfect truth, that he knew nothing of the matter.</p>

<p>Orders were then given to weigh anchor at the dawn
of the next day.</p>
